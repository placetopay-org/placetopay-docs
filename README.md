# PlacetoPay Docs

This documentation project contains all the information necessary to perform integrations with the PlacetoPay Checkout and PlacetoPay Gateway API services.

This project is made with the [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) Protocol template which was built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting started

To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Customizing

### Theory Page

These pages are made in MDX syntax and can be found inside the "pages" folder. The file format is `mdx` and the file name and location path from the "pages" folder is the path you will have in the application.

#### Steps to add a new entry

1. Create the file with the name and location corresponding to the path you want it to have in the application. Then, 
so `http://localhost:3000/my-folder/my-file` corresponds to a file called `my-file.mdx` inside the `my-folder` folder which is in the path `src/pages`.

2. Write the content of your file following the MDX syntax.
    - the `<title />` of the page will be the first header that has been declared in the file.
    - Second level headers (html: `h2` / mdx: `##`) autogenerate [URL fragments or hashes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/hash) which must be modified by adding `{{ id: 'your-has-here' }}` after the header text to be consistent with the language change.
    - Being MDX format, HTML tags are completely accepted and their functionality is the same as in a `.html` file.
    - The images used must be inside the `public/` folder, here they can be added directly to the root of the folder or create subfolders to have better order.

3. To add the route to the navigation panel you must follow the steps in this [section](#navigation).

4. Make sure you have saved all the changes made and enter the new route that was created.

#### Steps to modify an entry

1. Determine the path of the file to edit based on the URL path. So if the URL is `http://localhost:3000/my-folder/my-file` the file is located in `src/pages/my-folder/my-file`.

2. Open the file in your trusted code editor and modify it following the instructions in the previous section.

3. Save the file and see the changes in the browser

### API page

#### Steps to add a new endpoint

1. Identify if it should go under the scope of gateway or checkout.

2. Depending on the corresponding scope, the YML file located within `src/assets/YOUR_SCOPE/es.yml` must be opened in your code editor.

3. Following the [openapi v3.1 specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) add the new endpoint to the file.

4. Repeat the process in the `src/assets/YOUR_SCOPE/en.yml` file with the English language.

5. Open or create the file where you want this documentation to be viewed. These files must be within the corresponding scope (checkout / gateway) and within the `api-reference` subfolder.

6. Copy the content of the file located in `stubs/apiReference.mdx.stub` and paste it into the previously created file.

7. Replace the values ​​corresponding to the endpoint that you created in step 3 and declare the rest of the information you need on the page, the information that you are not going to use, remove it so that it does not appear in the browser.

8. Open the route you just added in the browser and enjoy the results!

#### Cases to take into consideration

- ***Cyclical dependencies:*** As developers we are characterized by avoiding duplicating code as much as possible, but many times this can result in a cyclic dependency if we are not careful with its use. Well, when building a new endpoint it may be possible to generate cyclic dependencies since these allow references to other schemas to avoid duplicating the same block of code. When doing this, which is completely valid, the main care must be taken not to create a cyclic reference (a schema that refers to another schema and that refers to the first one) since if this happens, the application breaks and does not present a clear error, causing a crash dump due to overuse.

### Navigation

The paths are auto-generated by the name and location of the files within the `src/pages` folder.

#### Step to add new item to sidebar navigation

1. Open the `src/constants/navigations`.

2. Add the new entry to the correct constant by following:

    - The `title` property is the text that will appear in the sidebar navigation.
    - The `href` property is the path that the browser will direct to when the user selects the element in the sidebar. 
        - Optional for the parent element of a subnav which turns it into a button to show or hide child links.
        - If added when it is a parent element of a group of subnavs it will be a common link and once the user is inside that page the children will be shown.
    - The `links` property is the array of links that will be displayed as sub-navigation of the parent element. These have the `title` and `href` properties to represent the link.

3. The process must be repeated for each language constant.

### Translations

In the project, the translations are file-based, so when you want to translate a path to English you must create the same file path within the `src/pages/en` folder and rewrite all the content in English.

This applies to theory pages and API pages.

### How to contribute to git

#### Steps to generate or modify a new entry

1. Creates a new branch from `develop` following the git flow convention it should be called with the prefix `Feature/`, `Refactor/` or `Fix/`.

2. Make your changes in that branch and commit progressively with your changes to avoid problems if a revert is necessary.

3. Push your changes to the repository and create a new Pull request.

4. Modify the description of your Pull Request with a brief explanation of the change and add Eduardo Gúzman as a Reviewer.

5. Notify by internal message about the existence of the PR to speed up review, merger and deployment times.

6. Wait for the change notice to be displayed and check in production that your changes are just as you expect.
