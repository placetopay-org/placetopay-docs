# Lightbox

Lightbox is a way to integrate Checkout that allows your users to complete the payment without leaving your website. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="flex flex-col-reverse xl:flex-row items-center xl:max-w-none">
  <div className="flex-1 items-center">
    When you use Lightbox, Checkout appears dynamically in the center of the screen, offering a reduced and integrated checkout experience on your website.
    
    This solution allows you to keep users on your website or application by providing them with convenience and facilitating the payment process.

    <div className="not-prose">
      <Button href="https://checkout.placetopay.com/demo" target="_blank" arrow="right" children="See live" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="max-w-md sm:ml-10 sm:mr-6">
    <img src="/Checkout_lightbox_2.webp" alt="Checkout lightbox" className="shadow rounded-md my-0"/>
  </div>
</div>

## Integration {{ id: 'integration' }}

Follow these steps to complete your integration successfully.

1. **Add Script:** Include the Lightbox script in your web page.
2. **Generate Process URL:** On your server (backend), [create a session](/en/checkout/api/reference/session#crear-una-sesion) and obtain the `processUrl`.
3. **Start Lightbox:** Share the `processUrl` with your client's (frontend) JavaScript code. Use this URL to initialize the Lightbox.
4. **Register Callback:** Capture the callback in your frontend to handle the response when the Checkout process ends.

### Add script {{ id: 'add-script' }}

To integrate Lightbox, you must add our script to your web page. This script is essential as it provides the necessary functionality to open and manage the Lightbox, allowing users to complete their payments without leaving your website.

The script contains the code required to create and control the Lightbox interface. It also ensures that your integration is compatible with the latest features and updates provided by Placetopay.

```html
<head>
	...
    <script src="https://checkout.placetopay.com/lightbox.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

The url referenced in the script can change according to the country and commercial provider with which you are integrating.

| Instance | URL Script |
| :--- | :--- |
| PlacetoPay International | <CopyContent content="https://checkout.placetopay.com/lightbox.min.js"/> |
| PlacetoPay Ecuador | <CopyContent content="https://checkout.placetopay.ec/lightbox.min.js" />|
| Getnet Chile | <CopyContent content="https://checkout.getnet.cl/lightbox.min.js" />|
| Getnet Uruguay | <CopyContent content="https://checkout.getnet.uy/lightbox.min.js" />|
| Davivienda Costa Rica | <CopyContent content="https://checkout.davivienda.cr/lightbox.min.js" />|
| Pago Link Atlántida | <CopyContent content="https://pagoenlinea.bancatlan.hn/lightbox.min.js" />|
| Atlantic Bank | <CopyContent content="https://abgateway.atlabank.com/lightbox.min.js" />|
| Goupagos | <CopyContent content="https://checkout.goupagos.com.co/lightbox.min.js" />|

<Note>Do not download and host this script yourself. Using our hosted script ensures that you always get the latest updates and features automatically.</Note>

### Content Security Policy (CSP) {{ id: 'csp' }}

If you implement a [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) in your application, it is essential to allow the domains used by Webcheckout to ensure the proper functioning of the payment gateway.

If you define only a [default-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/default-src), this directive will act as the default value for all other missing directives. Therefore, it is important to explicitly add the domains used by Webcheckout.

During session processing, the following domains must be included in your CSP configuration:

| Services                 | Domains                                                             |
|------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Placetopay Internacional | <CopyContent content="*.placetopay.com" />                          |
| PlacetoPay Ecuador       | <CopyContent content="*.placetopay.com *.placetopay.ec" />          |
| Getnet Chile             | <CopyContent content="*.placetopay.com checkout.getnet.cl" />       |
| Getnet Uruguay 		   | <CopyContent content="*.placetopay.com checkout.getnet.uy" />       |
| Davivienda Costa Rica    | <CopyContent content="*.placetopay.com checkout.davivienda.cr" />   |
| Pago Link Atlántida      | <CopyContent content="*.placetopay.com pagoenlinea.bancatlan.hn" /> |
| Atlantic Bank            | <CopyContent content="*.placetopay.com abgateway.atlabank.com" />   |
| Goupagos                 | <CopyContent content="*.placetopay.com checkout.goupagos.com.co" /> |

<Note>The list of domains may be updated at any time. It is important to review and update your CSP regularly to ensure compatibility with the latest Webcheckout requirements. </Note>

This is an example of a CSP configuration that allows the use of Webcheckout on the International instance:

```json

Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' *.placetopay.com; connect-src 'self' your-domain.com *.placetopay.com; img-src 'self' your-domain.com *.placetopay.com; frame-src *.placetopay.com;

```

### Generate Process URL {{ id: 'generate-process-url' }}

To generate the `processUrl`, you need to [Create a session](/en/checkout/api/reference/session#crear-una-sesion) on your server. The response will contain the `processUrl` field, which you need to send back to the browser.

### Start Lightbox

Share the process url `processUrl` with your client's (frontend) javascript code. Once it is available you can start the Lightbox.

```javascript
// Example URL
var processUrl = "https://checkout.placetopay.com/spa/session/76300/90443d4926a2...";

// When available, call
P.init(processUrl);
```

A lightbox containing the checkout page will be open on the user's browser, the user will be prompted to enter the payment details and complete the process.

<Note>
It is likely that the user's browser does not support starting the process in a lightbox.

For these cases, our library will handle redirecting the user to the processing URL, as it works in a traditional integration.

Redirecting is the default behavior; however, you can change this behavior by defining the `backupTarget` property. Learn more in [Alternative access to the processing URL](#alternative-access-process-url).
</Note>

### Register Callback {{ id: 'register-callback' }}

To make integration seameless, when the checkout process ends whithin the browsers lightbox session, a "callback" function will be issued to your web page vía javascript, make sure to capture it to aknowledge that the session has finished.

This will help you detect that the user has finished the process, then you must use your business logic and your backend services to fetch the actual data and continue with your application flow.

```javascript
// Register your callback
P.on('response', function (response) {
	// your business logic
	console.log(data);
});
```

The callback will have the `response` argument in which you will find the structure of a `sessionNotification` with the following information:

```json {{ 'title': 'SessionNotification' }}
{
	"reference": "ABC_123",
	"requestId": 12345,
	"signature": "bodySignature",
	"status": { 
		"date": "2023-07-11T11:34:37-05:00",
		"message": "The request has been successfully approved",
		"reason": "00",
		"status": "APPROVED"
	} 
}
```

## Advanced Integration {{ id: 'advanced-integration' }}

Know in detail the methods and events available

### P.init

Initialize the Lightbox.

```javascript
P.init(processUrl, options);
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `processUrl` | `string` | `required` <br/> processing URL |
| `options` |  `object` | Advanced Options |
| `options.opacity` | `number` | Lightbox background transparency. <br/> Default: `0.7` <br/> Number between 0 and 1 <br/> 1 indicates that the background is not transparent and 0 indicates that it is completely transparent. |
| `options.backupTarget` | `string` | Defines the alternative behavior when the lightbox cannot be opened normally. <br/> Default: `self` <br/> Possible values: `self`, `popup`, `blank` <br/> `self`: Redirect to the processing URL <br/> `popup`: Open a popup with the URL <br/> `blank`: Open in new tab |

### P.on

Subscribe to lightbox events.

```javascript
P.on(eventType, callback);
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `eventType` | `string` | `required` <br/> Name of the event to subscribe <br/> Possible values `response` `close` |
| `callback` |  `Function` | Callback function to be executed when the event occurs |


**Event listing**

| Event | Description | Params |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `response` | Called when a response is received from PlacetoPay. | `SessionNotification` |
| `close` | It is executed when the user closes the Lightbox or when it is automatically closed at the end of the process and it has been created with a `skipResult: true` | N/A |


```javascript
P.on('response', function (response) {
	console.log(response);
});


P.on('close', function () {
	console.log('The user closed the Lightbox');
});
```

It is also possible to subscribe to more than one event of the same type, you just have to register each one separately in `P.on()`.

### Alternative access to processing URL {{ id: 'alternative-access-process-url' }}

If the lightbox cannot be opened normally, the alternative access to the processing URL will depend on the `backupTarget` property passed to the lightbox configuration. The alternatives are:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `self` | Redirect to the processing URL |
| `popup` | Open a popup (popup window) with the processing URL |
| `blank` | Open in new tab with the processing URL |

The `backupTarget` property can be passed as an optional parameter when initializing the lightbox.

```javascript
P.init(processUrl, {
	backupTarget: 'self' // default
});
```

### Embedded use

If you want to use the lightbox in an iframe, you must prepare your application to catch the `placetopay-lightbox:redirect` message and redirect the main window to the URL that is available in the payload. This to support Safari and other browsers that by default do not allow third-party cookies.

The received `postMessage` will have the following structure:

```json
{
	"type": "placetopay-lightbox:redirect",
	"url": "https://checkout.placetopay.com/spa/session/123456/1234567890..."
}
```

You have to catch the message and redirect the main window to the URL that is available in the payload.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
	const data = typeof event.data === 'string' ? JSON.parse(event.data) : event.data;

	if (data.type === 'placetopay-lightbox:redirect') {
		window.location.href = data.url;
	}
})
```

## Integration example {{ id: 'integration-example' }}

Below is the simplest example of how you can integrate Lightbox into your HTML.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="es">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Lightbox SDK</title>
	<script src="https://checkout.placetopay.com/lightbox.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Lightbox SDK</h1>
	
	<button id="open">Open Lightbox</button>
	
	<script>
		<!-- Suscribe el evento close -->
		P.on('close', function () {
			alert('The user closed the Lightbox');
		});

		<!-- Suscribe el evento response -->
		P.on('response', function (response) {
			console.log(response);
		});

		<!-- Abre el Lightbox al hacer click en el botón -->
		document.getElementById('open').addEventListener('click', function () {
			var processUrl = "https://checkout.placetopay.com/spa/session/123456/1234567890abc1234567890abc12345";

			P.init(processUrl);
		});
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```
