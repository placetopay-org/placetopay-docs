# Document types

Placetopay API supports different document types depending on the country.

To define or use the `payer`, `buyer`, `shipping` and other attributes, you must append the `document` and `documentType` attributes. These data are validated by the API to ensure the format of the information.

Next we indicate the possible values of this field:

<DocumentsRules />
