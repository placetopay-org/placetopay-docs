# Process retries

WebCheckout allows users to retry the payment or tokenization process within the same session until a successful transaction is achieved or the allowed attempts limit is reached. {{ className: "leading" }}

Allowing retries is especially useful in situations where the user may have made a mistake entering payment details, or if the payment method was not accepted on the first attempt. This lets the user correct the information and try again without starting a new session, maintaining the same payment experience. It also reduces the number of sessions and integration processes that need to be managed, simplifying the experience for both the user and the merchant.

The merchant, according to their needs, can limit the number of **failed attempts** (transactions or tokenizations with `REJECTED` status) allowed during the processing of a session. This measure aims to protect the end user and prevent multiple invalid or malicious attempts within the same payment session.
This limit **is not based on the total number of transactions**, but only on those that have been rejected within the same session.
When the number of failed attempts reaches the configured limit (default value: `10`), the session will be marked with the [REJECTED](/en/checkout/how-checkout-works#checkout-session-states) status and no further processes will be allowed within that session.

## When does it apply?

This functionality is automatically activated during session processing, either through direct API integration or via Lightbox. The system tracks the number of rejected attempts and, once the configured limit is exceeded, the session is finalized and no further operations can be performed.

## What counts as a failed attempt?

Only the following processes are considered failed attempts:
- Transactions with rejected status (`REJECTED`)
- Tokenizations with rejected status (`REJECTED`)

## Other aspects to consider

The attempts limit applies only within the same session. If the user starts a new session, the failed attempts count will be independent.

This functionality can be combined with [Skip result](/en/checkout/skip-result) so that, during the process, there is only one failed attempt and the user is immediately redirected to the merchant.
