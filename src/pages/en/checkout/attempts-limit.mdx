# Session Attempts Limit  
WebCheckout includes a feature to limit the number of **failed attempts** (transactions or subscriptions with **rejected** status) during the processing of a session. This measure aims to protect the end user and prevent multiple invalid or malicious attempts within the same payment session.  
This limit **is not based on the total number of transactions**, but only on those that have been explicitly rejected by the system or the payment provider.  
When the number of failed attempts reaches the configured limit default: 10, the session is automatically marked with the status [REJECTED](/en/checkout/how-checkout-works#checkout-session-states), and no further processes are allowed within that session.

## When does it apply?
This functionality is automatically activated during session processing, either through direct API integration or via Lightbox. The system tracks the number of rejected attempts, and once the configured limit is exceeded, the session is finalized and no additional operations can be performed.

## What counts as a failed attempt?
Only the following processes are considered failed attempts:
- Transactions with rejected status
- Subscriptions with rejected status

Processes with approved, pending, or network error statuses are **not** counted.
