# Change history - Changelog

This file contains the improvements and updates made to the Checkout API.

## `2.27.0` 2025-06-10

### Added:
- A retry limit has been added to payment and tokenization processes within a session. This limit applies to failed attempts (transactions or tokenizations with a `REJECTED` status) and can be configured per site. The default value is `10` failed attempts. If this limit is exceeded, the session is marked with the `REJECTED` status and no further processes are allowed in that session. [Attempts limit](/en/checkout/attempts-limit)

### Changed:
- New `openingDate` and `beneficiaryId` fields have been added to the `metadata` property in the `CreateSessionRequest` and `CollectRequest` requests.
