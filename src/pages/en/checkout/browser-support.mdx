# Supported Browsers

Web Checkout is designed to provide a secure and stable experience on modern versions of the most widely used web browsers worldwide. {{ className: 'lead' }}

To ensure security and provide the best possible experience for the majority of our customers, we do not offer support for browsers that no longer receive security updates and are used by only a small fraction of users.

## Understanding browser support

At Web Checkout, we strive to provide the best possible experience for our customers, which is why we have defined a browser support policy based on the following principles:

- We cover browsers and browser versions that have more than 0.5% global market share.
- We cover the latest two versions of each browser.
- We do not cover browsers that no longer receive security updates or have been declared obsolete (dead).
- We do not cover Opera Mini, as it is not compatible with the modern technologies used in Web Checkout.
- We do not cover Internet Explorer 11, as it is not technologically compatible and has been declared obsolete and insecure by Microsoft.

These values correspond to the Browserslist rule `> 0.5%, last 2 versions, not dead, not op_mini all, not IE 11` [See More](https://browserslist.dev/?q=PiAwLjUlLCBsYXN0IDIgdmVyc2lvbnMsIG5vdCBkZWFkLCBub3Qgb3BfbWluaSBhbGwsIG5vdCBJRSAxMQ%3D%3D).

<Note>
    Some browsers outside of this rule may be supported with limited functionality, but their proper operation is not guaranteed.
