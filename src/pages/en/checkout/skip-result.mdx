# Skip Result
The Web Checkout API allows skipping or bypassing the summary view of a session with a process in a [final state](/en/checkout/how-checkout-works#checkout-session-states). This feature is useful if the integration has its own customized session summary view and does not require Web Checkout to display it.

To enable this feature, the `skipResult` property must be included with the value `true` in the `CreateSessionRequest` request of [session creation](/en/checkout/create-session). If this property is not sent or is set with a different value, it will default to `false`.

```json {{ 'title': 'CreateSessionRequest' }}
{
    "auth": {...},
    "payment": {...},
    "skipResult": true,
    "returnUrl": "https://dnetix.co/p2p/client",
    "ipAddress": "127.0.0.1",
    "userAgent": "PlacetoPay Sandbox"
}
```

## How Does It Work? {{ id: 'behavior-api' }}
When the session process is completed, the user is redirected to the URL specified in `CreateSessionRequest.returnUrl` without any user interaction.

## How Does It Work Using the Lightbox SDK? {{ id: 'behavior-lightbox' }}
For [Lightbox integrations](/en/checkout/lightbox), the `close` event is triggered, and the Lightbox window closes automatically without user interaction.
