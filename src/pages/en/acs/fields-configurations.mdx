# Configuration Fields

To access the Configuration Fields module, navigate to the left sidebar, expand the *System* menu, and select *Configuration Fields*.

## Configuration Fields Index and Actions

This module manages configuration fields for issuers. The module index displays a table listing all available fields.

These fields allow for the configuration and validation of data to be received, such as input fields displayed in the challenge user interface during authentication.

### Field Actions:

The following actions are available for configuration fields:

- Enable / Disable
- Edit
- View
- Create

## Configuration Field Details

You can view the status, category, type, field description and its translation, the assigned value, and the creation and update details for each configuration field.

## Creating a New Configuration Field

To create a new configuration field, click the **Create** button located on the right side of the *Configuration Fields* index.

When you click the create button, the first step is to select the data type for the new field.

### Field Data Types

- **SELECT:** Accepts a value selected from a predefined list.

- **BOOLEAN:** Accepts only true or false values.

- **DATE:** Accepts a date in a specific format.

- **NUMERIC:** Accepts numeric values.

- **STRING:** Accepts any value, including text, numbers, and symbols.

- **PASSWORD:** The value entered in this field is stored securely. The original value is typically replaced with special characters or encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm.

- **TRANSLATABLE:** Accepts a value that can be translated.

Depending on the selected data type, a different form will be displayed for field creation.

### Creation Form:

After selecting the data type, you will see the corresponding form. In this example, the *BOOLEAN* field type is selected.

The form requires the following information:

- **Name:** Enter the name for the new field.

- **Category:** Select the category in which the field will operate.

  The available categories are:

  - **GENERAL:** Fields in this category apply to all user interface types used in challenge authentication.

  - **UI_OTP:** This category stores fields that validate challenges using a user interface for OTP (one-time password), where the user enters the OTP code received.

  - **UI_SINGLE_SELECT:** This category stores fields that validate challenges using a user interface designed for single-option selection. For example, the cardholder is asked whether they prefer the OTP sent to their device or to their registered email address.

  - **UI_MULTI_SELECT:** This category stores fields that validate challenges using a user interface designed for multiple selections, allowing the user to provide several responses on a single screen. For example, the user is asked in which cities they have lived, and multiple options can be selected.

  - **UI_OOB:** This category stores fields that validate challenges using an out-of-band (OOB) user interface, allowing issuers to use alternative authentication methods such as a mobile app. The issuer provides instructions to the cardholder for completing the challenge authentication process.

  - **SERVICES:** This category stores fields that validate strategies for implementing ACS services such as OTP or cardholder information services.

- **Configuration Value:** Enter or select the default value for the field. This value is used as the initial configuration and can be edited later.

    For example, when creating a boolean field, only yes, no, true, or false values are accepted. Check the value you want to set for the field.

- **Description:** Enter the fieldâ€™s function description using the *en* prefix for English and the *es* prefix for Spanish.
