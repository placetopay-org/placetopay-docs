# Decoupled Authentications

To access the application's authentication management section, go to the left-hand menu, select *Dashboard*, and then *Decoupled Authentications*.

## Decoupled Authentications Index

This section lists all authentications that have entered a decoupled process, managed by the issuing bank to verify the cardholder's identity.

The *Decoupled Authentications* session is divided into three modules, each designed to manage authentications based on the required action.

**1. My Authentications Module:** When a user selects an authentication from the *Decoupled Authentications* module, it is moved here. This helps maintain organization and better manage ongoing authentications, allowing users to quickly identify which ones they have interacted with.

**2. Decoupled Authentications Module:** This module contains all authentications that are still pending decoupling and are waiting to be handled by an authorized user.

**3. Authentications Selected by Other Users Module:** This module allows users to view authentications currently being handled by other users. Note that only one user can resolve an authentication at a time, but multiple users with authentication permissions can observe them.

This modular division ensures better organization for users resolving authentications and helps prevent conflicts during the resolution process.


## Unassigned Authentications

The *Decoupled Authentications* module lists all authentications that have not yet been selected by any user. To take ownership, a user must open the authentication details, and the system will automatically assign it to that user for resolution.

### Releasing a Decoupled Authentication

If a user decides not to resolve a given authentication, they must release it by clicking the **Release** button located on the far right. This will allow another user to take over the resolution.

Each authentication has a predefined resolution time, configured with the issuing bank. If an authentication is not resolved within this timeframe, its status will change to *U* = Authentication Not Completed, indicating a technical error occurred during the process.

### Resolving an Authentication
Only users with the appropriate knowledge and permissions should resolve authentications. The system displays transaction data and related information for review.

To authenticate or reject an authentication, click the **Resolve Authentication** button. A pop-up window will appear with two options. Select the desired status and submit your response. The system will update the authentication status and display a confirmation message.

The updated status will be shown at the top left of the authentication details page.
