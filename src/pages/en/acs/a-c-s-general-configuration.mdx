# How to Configure the ACS?

To ensure optimal performance, ACS must be properly configured to validate, approve, and deny authentication requests according to the designed flow, which is based on the 3-D Secure Protocol specifications.

## Configuration Steps

**1.** Make sure you have a **user account with the necessary permissions** to perform configuration tasks. Log in to the application using your assigned credentials.

**2.** Select your preferred **language** for the application interface. English and Spanish are available. This option is located in the top-right corner of the application in a dropdown menu.

**3.** Locate and **familiarize yourself with the main modules** of the application and their functionalities. These modules are accessible from the left-hand navigation menu.


### Dashboard
This module provides the main ACS functionalities. It serves as the primary interface users interact with.

  Available features in this section:
  - Transaction processing metrics
  - Records and tools for processed authentications
  - Records and tools for decoupled authentications
  - List and management of reports generated in ACS
  - List and management of authentication disputes

Each module and its features are explained in detail in the *Features* section of this documentation.

### System
This module contains the components required to configure ACS and ensure its proper operation.

  The System menu includes:
  - List, management, and configuration of issuers
  - List and management of SSL certificates
  - List and management of brands
  - List and management of merchant category codes
  - List and management of supported currencies
  - List and management of supported countries
  - List and management of issuer-specific configurations
  - List and management of transaction amounts created in the application

These modules and their functionalities are covered in detail in the *Configuration* section and related articles.

### Security
This module manages access control, activity logs, permissions, and security features for ACS.

  The Security menu includes:
   - List and management of registered users
   - List and management of invitations for new users
   - Role management for ACS users
   - Profile management for ACS users
   - List and management of user activity logs

These modules and their features are detailed in the *Security* section of this documentation.

**4.** Create the **brands** certified for use with ACS in the *Brands* menu, and enable them as needed.

**5.** Create an **issuer** associated with ACS in the *Issuers* menu and enable it.

**6.** For each **issuer** created, go to its details page and perform the following **configurations**:
 
  - Enable and edit the **configuration fields** required by the issuer's business logic in the *Configurations* section of the issuer details.
    
  - Enable the **strategies** that instruct ACS which implementation to use for cardholder information services, OTP, and authorization. Strategies are found in the *Configurations* section under the last tab, *Services*, in the issuer details.

  - Subscribe available **brands** to the issuer in the *Operations* > *Subscribed Brands* section of the issuer details.

  - Manually create or import **card ranges** accepted by the issuer. Associate each range with its respective brand and specify whether decoupled challenge is supported.

  - Optionally, create one or more **fraud control rule lists** in the *Fraud Control Management* > *Manage Fraud Control Lists* section of the issuer details. These lists provide the first layer of authentication validation.

  - When an issuer is created, default **fraud control rules** are automatically generated to validate authentications. These rules are found in the *Fraud Control Rules* section of the issuer details. Review, edit, enable, or disable these rules as needed. At least one rule must always be enabled to validate authentications according to the ACS flow. Enabling more rules can increase the security of the cardholder authentication process. You can also create additional rules with different actions and characteristics in this section.

  - Optionally, create **rule groups** in the *Fraud Control Groups* section of the issuer details. Rule groups allow you to classify and group rules for specific validation purposes.

At this stage, it is important to note that all the steps above are explained in detail, including their purposes, locations, and processes, in the *Brand Configuration*, *Issuer Configuration*, and *Other Configurations* sections, available under *ACS Operation* > *Configuration* in this documentation.

**7.** Enable or disable **currencies** in the *Currencies* menu according to the requirements of the region where ACS will be used.

**8.** Create an **SSL certificate** in the *Certificates* menu. This certificate is required to establish secure communications.

  #### Create Private Key
  In this section, to ensure the issuer functions correctly, create a **CLIENT** type certificate. Select the previously configured issuer and a brand subscribed to that issuer.

  #### CSR: Certificate Signing Request
  Enter the location details where the certificate will be used. Then, provide the URL slug and generate the CSR (Certificate Signing Request), which will appear as an encrypted text block containing the entered information and the public key.

  #### Generate the SSL Certificate with the Certificate Authority
  Submit the CSR to your certificate authority to obtain the SSL certificate. Once received (as an encrypted text block), copy and paste it into the *Certificate* field of the *Certificate Request* and click *Save*.
  
  All concepts, purposes, and certificate creation steps are detailed in the *Other Configurations* > *Certificates* section of this documentation.

**9.** To manage **access control** and permissions, grant or revoke permissions for different features and users in the **Roles** section.

**10.** Create new **permissions** and access profiles in the **Profiles** section to manage access to different modules of the application.

**11.** Once the application is configured, you can start receiving authentication requests. These will be validated by the fraud engine, registered, and viewable in the ***Authentications*** section.

**12.** Manage **disputes** related to authentications processed by ACS in the *Disputes* menu. Track dispute statuses and download process reports. Disputes refer to claims regarding invalid or fraudulent transaction charges.

**13.** Monitor and manage **decoupled authentications** that require manual validation by the issuer to verify the cardholder's identity.

**14.** Review and evaluate application performance using **transaction metrics**.

**15.** Track **user activity** in the application via the **Security** > **Logs** section.

**16.** Send **invitations** to add new users in the **Invitations** section, and monitor user registration in the **Users** section.

**17.** Track **amounts** created in ACS in the **Amounts** section. Amounts may refer to card ranges or fraud rule lists.

**18.** Monitor authentications and abandonments in the authentication process by generating **authentication and abandonment reports** in the **Reports** section.

**19.** Review, edit, and familiarize yourself with the **merchants** you typically transact with, using the codes found in the **Merchant Codes** section.

All the above functionalities are described in detail in their respective documentation sections. Refer to the section titles and the general guide at the beginning of this document for navigation.
