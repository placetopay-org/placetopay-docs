# Metrics

Metrics are statistics that report the application's behavior regarding the flow of processed transactions.

To access the application's metrics management, navigate to the left sidebar where you will see three options: "Dashboard," "System," and "Security." Select the *Dashboard* option and then *Metrics*.

## Metrics Filters

To display specific data in the metrics chart, you must filter the authentications. To access the filters, click the *Filter* button located in the top-right corner.

The following data is required to filter transactions:

- **Date Range:** Select a time range with a start and end date in the calendar, then click the check button at the bottom to save the range.

- **Period:** Select the type of period for filtering. You can choose between:

    - **Day:** When selecting this filter, data will be graphed by day with dates.

    - **Day of the Week:** When selecting this filter, data will be graphed by day with names.

    - **Month:** This filter can be selected when the chosen date range is greater than one month. When selecting this filter, data will be graphed by month names.

- **Currency:** Select the currency with which you want to filter transactions.

- **Issuer:** Select the issuing bank for which you want to obtain processed transactions.

- **Country:** Select the country from the list for which you want to obtain transactions.

**Search Button:** To display the metrics data, click this button with the previously selected filter data.

**Clear Filters Button:** To generate new metrics, click the *Clear Filters* button and generate a new date range, currency, and issuer.

## Metric Types

ACS currently includes the following metric types:

### Transaction Status Metric

This metric displays in a chart the number of transactions processed by ACS, filtered by a date range and differentiated by the authentication status obtained.

At the bottom, you can view the date range used to obtain the metric and the number of transactions that met the filter criteria.

### Transaction Amount Metric

This metric displays in a chart the amount of successful transactions processed by ACS, filtered by a date range and differentiated by the authentication status obtained.

### Authentication Flow Metric

This metric graphs a comparison between the two possible authentication flows in ACS (with friction and without friction) based on filtered transactions. Additionally, it shows details for each flow.

#### Metric Details

  - **Without Friction:** To view details of the frictionless flow, click on the chart bar referencing *Without Friction* data. A chart will be displayed showing the resulting statuses of transactions performed with this flow.

  - **With Friction:** To view details of the friction flow, click on the chart bar referencing *With Friction* data. A chart will be displayed showing the challenge types (normal or decoupled) of transactions performed with this flow.

### Conversion Rate Metric

This metric shows the percentages of authentications, challenges, and authentication attempts. The data is graphed in a conversion funnel, which allows filtering authentications throughout the entire flow, enabling visualization of initial general authentications, those entering the challenge, and finally those that fail to pass the challenge. This provides a comprehensive overview of the operation and the number of cardholders authenticated in ACS.
