# Authentication Process Statuses

The following are the possible statuses that can be returned during an authentication process. Each status indicator is listed along with its description.

| Status | Description                                                                                                                |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Y      | Authentication successful.                                                                                                |
| N      | Authentication failed. The authentication was rejected, but the merchant may still approve the associated transaction.     |
| U      | Authentication not performed. A technical error occurred during the process.                                              |
| A      | Authentication attempt executed.                                                                                          |

| R      | Authentication rejected. Transactions with an R status should not be processed due to risk.                               |
| D      | Authentication requires a decoupled challenge, which is the issuer's responsibility.                                      |
| I      | Informational authentication, not supporting payment. Used for account verification.                                      |
