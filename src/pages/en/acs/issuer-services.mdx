# Issuer Services

The values configured in this category define the strategies to be used for implementing ACS services such as OTP, cardholder information service, or application access and authorization services. This includes the specific values required to configure each of these strategies or services.

## How to Access This Menu

The **Services** tab in the configurations section contains the available strategies for executing ACS services for the issuer.

These strategies must have their specific configuration values completed before they can be enabled.

# Cardholder Strategy

This strategy defines how the cardholder information service will be implemented. Enter the corresponding strategy in the field value.

  The following strategies are currently available:

  - **Standard Strategy:** Allows authentication of requests received by ACS using the standard strategy, which makes the decision to authenticate or not based on the received cardholder information.

  - **Standard No Auth Strategy:** Allows requests received by ACS to bypass authentication using the standard strategy.

  - **No Service Strategy:** Does not validate cardholder information and proceeds to execute the corresponding validation rules to approve or deny authentication.

  - **SisCard Strategy:** Allows authentication of requests received by ACS through the SisCard service.

  For the selected strategy, configure the following values:

  - **cardholderInfoURL:** Enter a valid URL to connect to the external service for obtaining cardholder information.

  - **cardholderInfoUser:** Enter the username provided by the cardholder service for connection and authentication.

  - **cardholderInfoPassword:** Enter the password provided by the cardholder service to complete authentication.

# OTP Strategy

This strategy defines how the OTP (One-Time Password) service will be implemented for the specific issuer. Enter the corresponding strategy in the field value.

  The following strategies are currently available:

  - **Standard Strategy:** Uses a PlacetoPay proprietary service to send and validate OTP.

  - **Diners Strategy:** Uses a Diners proprietary service to send and validate OTP.

  For the selected strategy, configure the following values:

  - **otpURL:** Enter a valid URL to consume the external service for OTP delivery.

  - **otpSize:** Enter a number indicating the number of digits the OTP should contain.

  - **otpRuleRegex:** Enter the regular expression that will validate the entered OTP.
  
  - **otpAuthMethod:** Select the indicator for the authentication method with the OTP service.

# Auth Strategy

This strategy defines how the ACS authorization service will be implemented. This service is used when ACS needs to consume an external service that requires authentication or authorization via token. Enter the corresponding OAuth authentication strategy in the field value.

  Currently, only one strategy type is available:

- **Standard OAuth Strategy:** Allows authorization of access to a service consumed by ACS using a standard strategy with a Bearer token.

 Also configure the following values for the strategy:

  - **authURL:** Enter a valid URL to consume the external OAuth authorization service.

  - **authUsername:** Enter the username provided by the OAuth authorization service for connection and authentication.

  - **authPassword:** Enter the password provided by the OAuth authorization service to complete authentication.

# Questionnaire Strategy

This strategy notifies ACS which implementation to use for the questionnaire service in challenge authentications.

Currently, only one strategy type is available:

- **Standard:** Allows performing a challenge with questionnaire using the following configurations:

  - **questionnaireUrl:** Enter a valid URL to consume the external questionnaire service.

  - **questionnaireVerifyAnswer:** Enter a valid URL to consume the external service for verifying entered responses.
   
  - **questionnaireAuthMethod:** Select the authentication method for this service from the list.

# Out-of-Band (OOB) Strategy

This strategy notifies ACS which implementation to use for the Out-of-Band service in challenge authentications.

Currently, only one strategy type is available:

- **Standard:** Allows performing an out-of-band challenge using the following configurations:

  - **oobCreateSession:** Enter a valid URL to consume the external service and create a session for the Out-of-Band service.

  - **oobVerifySession:** Enter a valid URL to consume the Out-of-Band service for session verification and final authentication status.

  - **oobAuthMethod:** Select the authentication method for this service from the list.

# Authentication Method Strategy

This strategy defines which method will be used to perform challenges for issuer authentications. Select the corresponding authentication type in the *Value* field.

Four authentication types are available:

- **OTP** Allows authenticating a cardholder using an OTP code. OTP (One Time Password) codes are single-use numeric codes used for a single transaction. They are typically sent to a cardholder each time a banking transaction is attempted.
- **SINGLE-SELECT** Allows presenting the cardholder with a challenge containing a question and multiple response options, of which only one is correct.
- **MULTI-SELECT** Allows presenting the cardholder with a challenge containing a question and multiple response options, of which two or more may be correct.
- **OOB** Allows performing a challenge that is completed outside of, but in parallel to, the 3DS flow. The challenge request is not used to carry data to be verified by ACS, but rather the entity responsible for performing the out-of-band challenge (typically the issuer) reports the final authentication status to ACS.
