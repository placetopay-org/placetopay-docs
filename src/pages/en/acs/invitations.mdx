# User Invitations

To access the Invitations module, navigate to the left sidebar, expand the *Security* section, and look for the *Invitations* option in the menu.

This module allows registered ACS users to manage invitations sent to other users or groups of users who wish to use the application.


## Invitation List

In this module, you can view the list of created invitations. The list displays the invitation name, status, and creation and update dates.


### Invitation Statuses

Invitations can have two statuses:

- **Accepted:** The invitation has been accepted by the user or group of users to whom it was sent.
- **Pending:** The invitation has not yet been accepted by the user or group of users to whom it was sent.


When an invitation is sent to multiple users, the status will indicate how many invitations have been accepted and how many have been sent.


## Invitations for Creating New ACS Users

New users can be created via invitations. An invitation is sent to one or more email addresses, redirecting the recipient to the PlacetoPay Accounts application. There, the user can register their personal information and password to gain access to ACS.

The information provided during registration must match the details used to send the invitation.


## How to Create an Invitation or Group Invitation

To create an invitation, click the *Create* button in the Invitations module.

Fields to complete:

- **Invitation Name:** The name used to identify the invitation.
- **Email Address:** Enter a valid email address where the invitation will be sent. You can enter one or more addresses to create a group invitation.
- **Copy Data from an Existing User:** Use this toggle to enable or disable the option to copy information (permissions) from an existing ACS user to the new user(s) you wish to create.
- **Profiles:** If you enabled "Copy Data from an Existing User," select one or more existing profiles to use as a template for the new user.
- **Roles:** If you disabled "Copy Data from an Existing User," select one or more existing roles to assign to the new user.

After completing the form, click the *Next* button.

This view displays the next step for creating an invitation.

#### Basic Invitation Information

At the top of this view, you will see the email address(es) to which the invitation will be sent and the copied role, if selected.

#### ACL Permissions Created for the Invitation

At the bottom of the view, you will find ACL-type permissions, which allow you to customize application access by granting or denying access to different sections.

Permissions are organized in a table showing the model for which the permission was created, the rule description, and a button to delete the permission.

### Create New ACL Rule

From the Invitations module, you can create new ACL rules to attach to the specific invitation for the users you wish to create.

To create a new rule, click the *Add ACL Rule* button on the right side of the view. A form will appear; complete the fields as follows:

#### Action

Select an option for the ACL rule:

- **Allow:** The rule will grant access to a specific module and action.
- **Deny:** The rule will deny access to a specific module and action.

#### Model

Select from the list the module for which you want to create a rule to allow or deny access.

#### Attribute

Select from the list the attribute or field of the module for which you want to create the rule.

#### Operator

Select from the list the operator to define the rule logic, for example:

- To compare a value (eq).
- To find a value in a list (in).

#### Value

Select from the list the value to assign to complete the rule.

### Conditionals

To add and save the rule, click the *Add Conditional* button. The created ACL condition or rule will then appear at the bottom of the view.
