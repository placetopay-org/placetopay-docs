# Imports

To access the Imports module, navigate to the left sidebar, expand the *System* menu, and select *Imports*.

In this section, you can view all file imports performed in ACS. For example, you will find files that import a list of card ranges for an issuer, as well as files used to import fraud control lists.

## Imports Index

In the imports index, you can view the details of each import and the current status of the import process.

Possible statuses are:

- **Completed:** The data import was successful and the file format was correct.

- **Failed:** The data import could not be completed due to one or more errors, either in the file format or in the request.

- **Pending:** The data import has not yet been completed.

## Actions for Imports

The only available action for imports is to view their details. To do this, go to the end of the import record, click the dropdown menu, and then click the **View** button.
