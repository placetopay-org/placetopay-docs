# SSL Certificates

To access the certificates module, go to the left sidebar menu, expand the *System* menu, and then select *Certificates*.

## What Are SSL Certificates and What Are They Used For?

This section allows you to create SSL certificates, which are digital certificates that cryptographically link a cryptographic key to an organization's data. SSL certificates enable website identity authentication and encrypt information sent to the server.

When a user attempts to transmit credentials to a web server, the browser uses the server's digital certificate to establish a secure connection. This process ensures secure data handling within ACS.

### Certificate Actions

Certificates can be viewed, edited, or deleted by clicking the dropdown menu located on the right-hand side of each certificate entry.

## Creating a Certificate

To create a new certificate in ACS, click the **Create** button located on the right side of the index. The certificate request or creation consists of three parts:

#### 1. Private Key Creation

**1.1.** hoose the key type to be used for encrypting the certificate. The following key types are available:

- **RSA** is a key created using the RSA algorithm, a public key cryptographic system that uses integer factorization and encrypts data blocks. It is the most commonly used algorithm for creating these keys.

  A private key can only be decrypted by its associated public key, which is created and linked to a unique private key.

- **EC** is a key based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which promises stronger security and better performance by using shorter keys. The cryptographic system used is based on elliptic curve mathematics.

  This key is used for SSH-based server authentication. The user must have a private key, and the server must store the corresponding public key.

**1.2.** Select the encryption method based on the connection type. Two encryption modes are available::

- **AES_128_CBC:** A type of encryption where Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a block cipher scheme and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) is an operation mode for a block cipher unit. This encryption type has a 128-byte size and is the most commonly used.

- **AES_256_CBC:** A block cipher type that uses CBC operation mode. This encryption type has a 256-byte size.


**1.3.** Key size in bits.

**1.4.** Key type. The key will function for a client, server, etc.

**1.5.** Brand for which the certificate is intended.


#### 2. Certificate Signing Request

In this step, youâ€™ll enter general information about the certificate requester:

- **Country:** Select the country where the certificate is created from the dropdown list.

- **State:** Enter the state name where the organization is located.

- **Locality:** Enter the city name where the organization is located.

- **Organization name:** Enter the organization name for which the certificate is created.

- **Organizational unit name:** Enter the department or area name of the organization for which the certificate is generated.

- **Common name:** Enter a valid domain name, which is the title or name of the organization's website.

- **Email:** Enter the email address of the certificate requester.

#### 3. Tracking Information


Allows identification through a slug, which forms part of the URL that will be used to access the server via the certificate.

## Certificate Registration and Signing

- In the first section, you can see the data entered in the private key creation form.

- In the second section, an encrypted text block is displayed representing the CSR or certificate signing request, necessary for signing and creating the SSL certificate.

- In the third section, you have the option to register the obtained certificate after signing it with your certificate authority.

#### How to Sign the Certificate

**1.** Copy the CSR block corresponding to the certificate signing request. Include the "---BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST---" and "---END CERTIFICATE REQUEST---" tags.

**2.** Go to your certificate authority and sign the certificate with the copied CSR text block.

**3.** After completing the certificate signing process, you will receive a text block similar to the first one you copied. Copy this block, including the "---BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST---" and "---END CERTIFICATE REQUEST---" tags. This text block corresponds to the certificate itself.

**4.** In the certificate details, at the bottom you will find the option to register your certificate. Click the link named *Here!*.

**5.** This will direct you to the following view, where you must paste the second text block you copied (which corresponds to your certificate) in the *Certificate* field.

**6.** Click save, and with this you obtain a valid signed certificate to secure information transfer with ACS.

In the certificates index, verify in the data table that the *Certificate* field shows the status **Found**, which indicates the certificate is correct. If it shows **Not Found**, you must repeat the signing process, as this status indicates an error in the certificate creation and signing process.
