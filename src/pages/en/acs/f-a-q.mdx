# Frequently Asked Questions about ACS Functionality

---

## What does ACS stand for?

ACS stands for Access Control Server.

## What is the purpose of ACS?

TThe ACS application verifies whether authentication is available for a card number, playing a critical role in authenticating cardholders during the transaction process. During authentication, ACS is responsible for validating the data entered and registered for a transaction.

## Why should cardholders be authenticated?

Authentication helps reduce the risk of fraud in online transactions by verifying the account, confirming the cardholder's identity, and validating the transactional and personal information provided.

## How is the cardholder authentication process configured?

The 3-D Secure Protocol defines the infrastructure and guidelines for authenticating cardholders during e-commerce transactions.

We recommend reviewing the entire documentation, as each section describes specific scenarios you may encounter and their respective solutions.
