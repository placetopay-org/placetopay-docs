To access the application's authentication management module, go to the left-hand menu, select *Dashboard*, and then *Disputes*.

## Disputes Overview

As mentioned in the *Authentications* module, disputes are claims initiated by a customer in response to a potential fraud case involving a transaction.

This section records and lists all disputes processed for various authentications.

For each dispute, you can view detailed information and download the dispute as a PDF report.

### Dispute Report

The generated PDF file for a dispute includes the dispute status and history, basic dispute information, cardholder details, and the authentication trace with all related requests and responses.

### Filters

This module also provides filters to help you search for specific disputes by dispute outcome, responsible agents, actions, transaction identifiers, and more.

To learn more about additional dispute functionalities such as creating, cancelling, resolving, viewing history, and downloading dispute reports, go to the **Authentications** section of this documentation, and then to the **Dispute Management** title.
