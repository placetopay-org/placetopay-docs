# Brand Subscription

## How to Access

To access this feature, click on the **Operations -> Subscribed Brands** menu, which is currently located to the right of the *Issuer Details* menu.

This view displays the list of brands registered for the issuer, along with a form to subscribe new brands.

For each brand, you can access the *Edit* and *Delete* options by clicking the dropdown menu at the end of the corresponding row.

### How to Subscribe a New Brand

To subscribe a new brand to your issuer, click the **Create** button located on the right side of the brand list. Then select the brand from the available list, the protocol version, and the corresponding SSL certificate.

If the application displays the message *"No available certificates found to subscribe this brand."*, you must create an SSL certificate before proceeding with the brand subscription process.
