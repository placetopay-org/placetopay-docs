 Code   | Description                                            | Recommended Action                                        |
--------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
 101    | Invalid message received                               | This error indicates that the value in the **messageType** field is invalid, inappropriate, or unrecognized. If this error occurs, contact your development team and provide a full error report to investigate the cause and determine a solution.                                                                      |
 102    | Unsupported message version                            | This error means the protocol version received in the **messageVersion** field is not supported. If encountered, contact your development team and submit a complete error report for further analysis and resolution.                                                                                                   |
 103    | Message rate limit exceeded                            | This error occurs when a component exceeds the allowed number of messages within a specific time frame. It is recommended to retry the authentication process after some time.                                                                                                                                           |
 201    | Required data element missing                          | This validation error occurs when a required field is missing from a message. The service will indicate the missing field; resubmit the authentication request including the missing data.                                                                                                                               |
 202    | Unrecognized critical message extension                | The **messageExtension** field contains a "criticalityIndicator" and an "ID" that identifies it. This error occurs when the ID cannot be recognized. Ensure all critical extensions are properly identified.                                                                                                             |
 203    | Invalid data element format                            | This validation error indicates that one or more fields in the message have an invalid format. Review the indicated fields and resubmit the authentication request with corrected data.                                                                                                                                  |
 204    | Duplicate data element                                 | This error means duplicate data was sent in a message. Review your request, remove any repeated elements, and resend the request.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
 301    | Unrecognized transaction ID                            | This error occurs when a transaction identifier is not recognized or is duplicated. For more information, contact the issuer to verify the transaction ID.                                                                                                                                                               |
 302    | Data decryption failure                                | This technical error indicates a required decryption process failed. If this occurs, contact your development team and provide a full error report for analysis and resolution.                                                                                                                                          |
 303    | Access denied, invalid endpoint                        | This error may indicate insufficient permissions to access a service endpoint or an invalid redirect. If encountered, contact your development team and provide a complete error report for investigation.                                                                                                               |
 304    | Invalid ISO code                                       | This error occurs when the ISO code in the **mcc** field is not supported by the ACS or is excluded. Refer to the list of supported countries or currencies as appropriate. If the code is not excluded, contact your development team to verify the authentication flow and the cause of the error.                     |
 305    | Invalid transaction data                               | This error may have several causes depending on the authentication trace. For example, the card number in **acctNumber** may not be within the issuer's range. Check the issuer's console under **Manage Card Ranges** to verify if the card is listed. Alternatively, the transaction ID may have already been processed. |
 306    | Invalid Merchant Category Code (MCC)                   | The MCC provided in the message is not valid for the payment system, possibly due to an inconsistency. Verify the MCC in the console under **Merchant Category Codes**. If the information is correct, contact the issuer for further details.                                                                           |
 307    | Invalid serial number                                  | This error indicates the value in the **serialNum** field was not found or is outdated. Verify this information with the corresponding issuer.                                                                                                                                                                           |
 402    | Transaction expired                                    | This error occurs when the transaction times out. The payment session has expired and a new one must be initiated.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
 403    | Transient system failure                               | This error may occur, for example, when processing is slow, causing failures. Regularly monitor service performance and report recurring issues to the development team for optimization and improvement.                                                                                                                |
 404    | Permanent system failure                               | This error occurs when a critical part of the flow is not functioning or cannot be accessed, such as the database for queries or data storage. Report the error to the development team for verification and resolution.                                                                                                 |
 405    | System connection failure                              | This error typically occurs when a required connection cannot be established, such as with an external service for OTP generation or decoupled authentication requests to the issuer. Contact the service provider experiencing the failure to resolve the issue.                                                        |
