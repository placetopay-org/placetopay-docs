# Issuers in ACS

## What is an Issuer?

An issuer, or issuing bank, is the financial institution responsible for issuing payment methods such as debit or credit cards. These payment cards are issued under the association's brand. There may also be issuers of proprietary, non-franchised payment cards.

Issuer responsibilities include:

- The issuer is responsible for authorizing or declining a transaction when it receives purchase data.

- The issuer handles the transfer of funds from a consumer purchase to the acquirer, who in turn pays the merchant and maintains the relationship with them.

- The issuer must provide required maintenance for accounts and cards.

- The issuer is responsible for resolving disputed charges in their favor due to fraud or risk reasons.

- The issuer handles activating, suspending, and blocking payment cards when required.


## How to Access ACS Issuer Management

To access the issuer list in the application, navigate to the left sidebar where you will see three options: "Dashboard," "System," and "Security." Select "System" and then "Issuers."

## How to Create an Issuer in ACS

To create an issuer, click the **Create** button located on the right side of the issuers index.

Complete the form with the following information:

- **Name:** Enter the name of the issuing bank you want to create.
- **Country:** Select the country where the issuing bank operates from the dropdown list.
- **Currency:** Select the currency used by the issuing bank for transaction processing from the dropdown list.
- **Slug:** Enter a key string for the issuer. This string will be added to URLs where issuer configurations and services are managed.
- **Logo:** You can upload an image with the issuer's logo. Click the *Select File* option and locate the logo image on your device. The image should have maximum dimensions of 1000x1000.

### Data Validation

For the ACS issuer creation form, and for all application forms in general, data validation functionality is available to ensure the integrity and validity of information entered in forms.

When completing the form, you may encounter two types of validations:

**1. Client-side Validations:**

These validations occur when data does not meet minimum acceptance rules and there is no need to send the response to the server, as the information has been previously validated as incorrect. They are displayed with red messages for the erroneous field and provide the user with guidance on how to complete the field correctly. If there are errors in these validations, the application prevents form submission.

**2. Server-side Validations:**

These validations are applied when a form or information is sent to the server and does not meet required validations, generating an error, denying the request, and showing the user the encountered error. These validations execute when they have not been registered as client-side validations, are complex to validate on the client side, or the user manages to bypass the first client validation filter with incorrect information. However, this validation filter stops requests with invalid data.

## Requirements for Creating an Issuer in ACS

To create and configure an issuer in ACS, it must have issued payment cards with brands that have already been certified to work in ACS.

The country and language used to create the issuer must be available for ACS.

A relationship must exist between the issuer, acquirer, and merchant, and they must be registered in the ACS and 3DSS applications of PlacetoPay Evertec to achieve a successful authentication process.

It is important to enable all configuration fields in the *Configuration Fields* menu before creating the issuer, as all these fields are required for the basic operation of an issuer.

At this point, it is important to remember that the **3DSS** application also implements and belongs to the flow proposed by the 3-D Secure protocol to authenticate a cardholder. It belongs to the acquirer domain, and among its main functions are:
- Receiving and responding to authentication requests sent by the merchant or payment gateway.
- Requesting payment authorization from the issuer.
- Responding to the merchant or payment gateway with the final authentication status.

## Issuer Index

This section displays the issuer list or index. Information is presented in a table showing the main data for each issuer, such as: Name, Country, and Status.

### Available Actions for Issuers

In the "Actions" column on the right side of the issuer index, there is a dropdown menu. Click this menu to access the available actions or functionalities for each issuer. The following actions are available:

- **View:** Select this option to view the issuer's details, configurations, and components.
- **Edit:** Select this option to update or correct the data used to create the issuer.

  You will see a form similar to the issuer creation form. All data is editable.

- **Enable or Disable:** Use the switch button to enable the issuer if it is currently disabled, or to disable it if it is currently enabled.

  When enabling or disabling, the application will provide a confirmation message similar to the following and immediately change the status of the edited issuer.

### How to Enable an Issuer

**1. Enable Required Configuration Fields:** In the *Configuration Fields* menu of the application, enable all configuration fields (you must enable them before creating the issuer), as these are required for issuer activation. For more information about configuration fields, refer to the **Configuration Fields** section of this document.

  If any field is disabled, expand the menu on the right side and select the *Enable* option.

**2. Enable Issuer Strategies:** In the issuer details, in the *Configurations* tab, and then in the *Services* tab, you will find the available strategies for the issuer (this functionality is explained later). You must enable three strategies (cardholderStrategy, otpStrategy, and authStrategy).

    If you attempt to enable the issuer with one or all strategies disabled, it would throw an error and would not allow the issuer activation to proceed.

**3. Subscribe Brand to the Issuer:** In the **Operations -> Subscribed Brands** tab of the issuer details, select a brand from the list. If no brands are available, you must go to the *Brands* menu of the application and create a new brand for the issuer. For this, refer to the *Brand Configuration* section of this documentation.

**4. Configure Card Ranges for the Issuer:** In the **Operations -> Manage Card Ranges** tab of the issuer details, click the *Create* button and create card ranges manually or by import. For this, refer to the *Card Range Management* section of this document.

**5. Create CLIENT Certificate for Issuer Brands:** To enable an issuer, you must create a *CLIENT* certificate in the *Certificates* menu, selecting the corresponding issuer and a subscribed brand for the same issuer. Then you must sign the certificate with the certification authority, and in the certificates index, it should register in the *Certificate* field with the *Found* status, indicating that it was correctly validated.

  To create the certificate, refer to the **Other Configurations** section, **SSL Certificates** tab.
