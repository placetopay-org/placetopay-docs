## What is an Issuer?

An issuer, or issuing bank, is the financial institution responsible for issuing payment methods such as debit or credit cards. These payment cards are issued under the association's brand. There may also be issuers of proprietary, non-franchised payment cards.

Issuer responsibilities include:

- The issuer is responsible for authorizing or declining a transaction when it receives purchase data.

- The issuer handles the transfer of funds from a consumer purchase to the acquirer, who in turn pays the merchant and maintains the relationship with them.

- The issuer must provide required maintenance for accounts and cards.

- The issuer is responsible for resolving disputed charges in their favor due to fraud or risk reasons.

- The issuer handles activating, suspending, and blocking payment cards when required.
