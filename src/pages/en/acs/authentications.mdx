# Authentications

To access the authentication management module, navigate to the left-hand menu, select Dashboard, then click on Authentications. 

## Authentication Index

This module displays information about all authentication attempts processed by the ACS. The initial view provides a list of transactions including their date, status, and other relevant details. You can expand each transaction to see more information by clicking the date link.

## Filters

To search for a specific list or transaction, you can use the available filters. ACS provides two types of filters for authentications: a basic filter and an advanced filter for more detailed queries.

To access this functionality, click the *Filter* button located at the top left of the view:

#### Basic Filters

You can search by:

- **Date range:** Click a start date on the calendar, then select an end date (the range must not exceed 60 days and cannot go beyond the current date). Click the black button to save the date range.

- **Transaction ID:** Enter the unique identifier for the transaction.

#### Advanced Filters


When the basic filters are expanded, there is an option *Show advanced filters*. Select it to display a view like the following:

In addition to the basic filters, you may also filter by:

- BIN
- Last 4 digits of the card number
- Card number
- Country
- Issuing bank
- Brand
- Transaction status


## Authentication Details

In the authentication detail view (accessible by clicking the transaction date link), you will find essential information about the authentication process, such as the authentication status, basic transaction information, cardholder details, merchant information, delivery data, and a timeline with message details and traces for the entire authentication process, as defined by the 3-D Secure protocol.

### Scoring

Some authentications include a security score. This score determines the risk level of the transaction, based on the history of transactions with similar characteristics.

### Delivery Information

This section displays information related to the location where the goods or services purchased in the transaction will be delivered. A map with the delivery location may also be shown.

### Authentication Messages

Each authentication includes a message trace, which in ACS is represented as a sequential log of all messages created and responded to during the authentication process. This includes received data, requests and responses, status updates, and error descriptions if any occur.


Each step also has a *View more* option, which displays the structure of the request or response along with its respective data.

# Disputes


Disputes are claims initiated by a customer associated with an authentication in ACS, which may involve suspected fraud.

## How to Create a Dispute

To create a dispute, at the top of the authentication detail view, click the **Create new dispute** button.

After this, an open dispute case will be added to the authentication.

## Dispute Details

To view the details of a created dispute, click the **View more** option. You will be redirected to a section within the same view, where disputes for that authentication are managed.

## Dispute History
In the dispute detail view, on the right side, you can view the dispute history by clicking the *History* dropdown button. All actions taken on the dispute will be displayed, including their respective statuses, the responsible agent, the action, justification, and the opening and update dates.

## Dispute Report

You can download a PDF report containing the dispute history and all information related to the transaction and authentication process. To do so, click the *Download report* button, found in the dispute details on the right side.

## Actions for Open Disputes

For disputes with **Open** status, the following actions are available:

**1. Cancel:** By clicking the *Cancel* button, a window will appear to enter the reason for canceling the dispute. Use this option when the dispute is not valid for a reason that will be recorded.

**2. Resolve:** By clicking the *Resolve* button, a form will be presented where you must enter the reasons for resolving the dispute. Use this option when a response has been provided by the issuing bank responsible for reviewing the dispute case.

Complete the form with the following information:

- **Responsible agent:** Refers to the agent responsible for the cause that originated the dispute.
- **Dispute outcome:** This outcome is based on the response provided by the institutions responsible for evaluating the dispute. If the outcome is not listed, select *Other* and describe the result.
- **Action:** Select the agent who will be responsible for the dispute outcome.
- **Justification:** In the text box, provide the reasons for resolving the dispute or any additional information you wish to record for the case.

## Actions for Closed or Canceled Disputes

For disputes in a **Closed** or **Canceled** state, the following action is available:

**1. Reopen:** This option is available for disputes marked as Closed or Cancelled. Clicking Reopen will change the dispute status back to Open, allowing you to either resolve or cancel it again.
