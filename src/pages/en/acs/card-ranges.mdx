# Card Ranges

## How to Access

To access this menu, click on **Operations -> Manage Card Ranges** at the top of the view.

In this section, you can import or manually create card ranges accepted for a specific issuer. The main information for each range is displayed in a table, including: the BIN, start and end of the range, brand, class, whether decoupled challenge is allowed, and the available actions for each range.

## Card Range Actions

The available actions for card ranges are found in the dropdown menu at the end of each range row. The actions are as follows:

- **View:** Opens the range details, including creation and update timestamps and the users who performed each action.

- **Edit:** Select this option to update or correct the data used to create the range. You will see a form similar to the one used for creating a card range. All fields are editable.

- **Delete:** Removes the card range from the issuer. Note that if a transaction is submitted with a card number falling within this deleted range, the authentication request will be rejected.

## How to Create a Card Range


When clicking the **Create** button, two options will appear:

**1. Create Card Range:** This allows you to manually create a card range.

  When filling out the form, consider the following:

   - **Brand:** Select the brand name to which the range will be registered.

   - **Class:** Enter the class name for the card range, e.g., Gold, Platinum, etc.

   - **Start range:** Enter the initial BIN digits and add additional digits to indicate the start of the range. The value must be at least 13 digits.

  - **End range:** Enter the initial BIN digits and add additional digits to indicate the end of the range, which must be greater than the start range. The value must be at least 13 digits.

  - **Decoupled challenge:** Check or uncheck this box depending on whether decoupled challenge processing is allowed for this range.

**2. Import Ranges:** This option allows you to import card ranges from a CSV file.

You must select the brand for which the ranges will be uploaded and a CSV file (comma-separated values) containing the range information.

The file must contain four lowercase column headers, separated by commas:

**1. start_range**: Indicates the initial value for the card range.

**2. end_range**: Indicates the final value for the card range.

**3. class**: Refers to the class or type of card used, e.g., Gold, Platinum.

**4. action**: Indicates the action to be performed for the specified range. The possible actions and their indicators are:

 - **I**: Insert range.

 - **U**: Update range.

 - **D**: Delete range.

These headers must be followed by their respective values in rows below, also separated by commas, with no spaces.

To view an example CSV file format, click the *Download* option on the left side of the form.
