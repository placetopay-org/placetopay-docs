# Merchant Category Codes

To access the Merchant Category Codes module, navigate to the left sidebar, expand the *System* menu, and select *Merchant Category Codes*.

## Merchant Category Codes Index

This section displays the index or list of codes related to merchant categories for which ACS processes authentications. The information is organized in a table showing relevant code data such as the numeric code and its description.

## Module Function

This module is provided to clients for informational and clarification purposes. During authentication, when processing the *AReq* message, ACS processes a field called *mcc* (Merchant Category Code), which contains the merchant category codeâ€”a 4-digit numeric value that is not immediately clear. This list of codes facilitates understanding of the merchant type and description referenced by each code.

## Actions and Creation of Merchant Category Codes

The available functionalities are:

- **Code Search:** Using the search box located in the top-left corner of the screen, you can search for a specific code. You can search using a code fragment, the complete code, or a fragment of the code description.

- **Edit and Delete:** In the menu located at the end of each code, a list with edit and delete buttons is displayed. This functionality is used according to client requirements.

- **Create New Code:** To create a new code, click the **Create** button located on the right side of the screen.

Complete the form with the following information:

- **Code:** Enter a 4-digit numeric value that is included in the ISO 18245 list, which is a standard responsible for assigning merchant category codes for use in financial services.

- **Description:** Two fields are provided. In the field with the *en* prefix, enter the English description for the code being created, and in the field with the *es* prefix, enter the same description in Spanish.
