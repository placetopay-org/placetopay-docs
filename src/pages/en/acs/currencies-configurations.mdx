# Currencies Used in ACS

To access the currencies module, go to the left sidebar menu, expand the *System* menu, and then select *Currencies*.

## Currencies Index

This section displays the index or list of currencies created for use in ACS. The information is organized in a table showing the most relevant currency data: name, alphabetic code, numeric code, and status.

#### Currency Search

The index also includes a currency search feature to facilitate your searches. You can search by currency name or part of it, and by alphabetic and numeric codes.

#### Pagination

The index includes a paginator at the bottom of the view, allowing you to view grouped data lists that are easier to navigate.

## Currency Actions

In the currencies index, you can access the available actions for currencies:

- You can view the details of each currency by clicking the *View* option.

- You can edit the information used to create currencies by clicking the *Edit* option.

- You can enable or disable currencies by toggling the switch button labeled *Enable* when the currency is disabled, or *Disable* when it is enabled and you want to disable it. Use this function according to the needs of the territory where ACS services will be used.

To access these functions, go to the dropdown menu located at the end of each currency entry in the table.
