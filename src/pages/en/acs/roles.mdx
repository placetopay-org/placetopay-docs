# Roles

To access this module, navigate to the left sidebar menu, expand the *Security* option, and select the *Roles* section.

## Roles Index

This module manages the application's user roles. Initially, you will see a list of created roles, which can be viewed, edited, or deleted by clicking the options in the dropdown menu on the right side.

## How to Create a New Role

You can also create new roles using the **Create** button located on the right side. You must provide a name and optionally a description for the new role.

## Role Functionalities

At the bottom of the role details, there is a section with three tabs, each directing to a different functionality:

### 1. Permissions

By clicking the *View* option for a role, you will see the details of the selected role, and at the bottom of the screen, you will find a menu:

Here, you can search for permissions related to various ACS functionalities, select them, deny or grant them. These permissions determine the features and actions the role can access.
Additionally, you can grant or deny other roles to the current role.

### 2. Ancestor Roles

This section lists the roles that are using the current role. This occurs when a role is granted to another role in the *Permissions* menu.

By creating child roles, you can extend the functionalities and permissions of a parent role without needing to reassign a list of permissions.

### 3. Used By

This section lists the users who are assigned the selected role.
