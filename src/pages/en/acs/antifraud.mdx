# Fraud Control Engine

## What is the fraud control engine?

It is a component of ACS responsible for managing rules, lists, and groups used to validate the data submitted during an authentication process. These rules help assess the authenticity and security of the information received, allowing the system to approve only valid authentication requests and apply filters that optimize the validation process.

## What does this engine do?

The main functionality of the ACS is the anti-fraud control engine, which allows validating the information received in the authentication request through a set of rules that validate the authentications of each registered issuer.

This feature is managed from the Issuers section of the application.


# Fraud control lists

Fraud control lists are the first filter through which ACS authentication requests pass.

These lists are executed before fraud control groups and, depending on their validation results, may prevent a request from needing further evaluation by rule groups.

## Rule list index:

To access the rule list index, go to the menu **Manage fraud control -> Manage fraud control lists**, in the tabs located at the top of an issuer's detail page.


## Rule list actions:

Available actions can be found in the dropdown menu at the end of each list. These include:

- **View:** View the list's details.

- **Edit:** Update or correct list details. This will open a form similar to the one used during list creation. All fields are editable.

- **Delete:** Remove the list.


## Rule List Filters:

ACS provides filtering functionality for rule lists, making it easier to search through large datasets

To filter, go to the right side of the rule list index. Next to the Create button, youâ€™ll find the Filter option.

You can filter by list type. After selecting the type, click Search to apply the filter or Clear filters to reset your search.

## Rule List Types:

These lists are temporary, meaning they have a specific duration that you assign when creating them, and are divided into two types:

- **Permissive:** These lists will create a filter that allows authentications that meet the registered values to be exempt from the execution of rule groups and thus continue with the authentication process.

  In this list, you can add values of customers with safe and reliable histories, as being permissive, it will be more flexible when validating the authentication.

- **Restrictive:** On the other hand, this type of list, when evaluating that the authentication data matches the list data, will send the authentications directly to execute the rule groups.

  In this list, you can add values of customers with risky histories. Being restrictive, the list will allow greater control over validation filters.

## How to create a fraud control list?

Click the Create button on the right side of the list index. Two creation methods will be available:

**1. Create a fraud control list:** This option allows you to create a list manually and individually.

Required fields:

- **Start date:** The date when the list will start functioning and performing validations.
- **End date:** The date when the list will stop functioning and validating rules.
- **List type:** ACS provides two types of lists (PERMISSIVE and RESTRICTIVE), choose one according to the type of validations to be performed.
- **Value type:** Here you select the parameter by which the authentication filters will be made.
    
    The following are the available value types:

   - **IP:** Internet Protocol. The public address that identifies a device connected to a network using the protocol.
   - **PAN:** Primary Account Number. The card number that appears on the front of a payment card.
   - **EMAIL:** Buyer's email address.
   - **MERCHANT_ID:** Merchant identifier number.
   - **MCC:** Merchant Category Code. Refers to the merchant's category code.
   - **Value:** Corresponds to the value of the parameter type selected in the previous field. This value is used for validations and to check for data matches with those received in the authentication.


**2. Create fraud control list import:** With this option, you can create rule lists in bulk from a file containing the rules.

  Accepted file formats: .CSV, .TSV, or .TXT.

  In the form, click the *Select file* option and browse your computer for the file you want to upload. Then click the *Save* button.

  To view an example of the import format, click the *Download* link, located on the left side, under the *Basic information* title.

# Fraud control rules

Rules allow you to validate the data received in authentication requests. These rules evaluate the match between the conditions contained in the rule and the data obtained in the authentication request.

  When you create an issuer in ACS, a series of default rules will automatically be added to the issuer. These will be found in this section, and you can enable, edit, or disable them as needed.

## Rule index:

To access the fraud control rule index, go to the menu **Manage fraud control -> Fraud control rules**, located in the tabs at the top of an issuer's detail page.


## Rule Actions

Each rule includes a dropdown menu with two available actions:

- **View:** Select this option to view more details about the rule. Click the button labeled *View* at the end of each rule.

- **Activate/Deactivate:** Slide this switch button to activate or deactivate a rule.

   If you disable a rule, you will not be able to validate authentication with the rule's parameters. Also, you must always have enabled rules to perform a successful and reliable authentication process.

## How to Change Rule Execution Order?

Rules are executed and validated in the order given in the rule index. New rules you create will automatically be placed below the last created one and will be executed in that order (only rules with *Active* status are executed).

To change the order of the rules, press and hold the rule you want to move and drag it to the desired location. A message will then appear saying: *"There are unsaved changes, if you leave this page you may lose them!"*

At the bottom of the index, you will see two buttons, press **Save changes** to confirm the change or **Reset changes** to revert to the previous order.

## Rule requests:

Click the *Rule requests* tab, located at the top right of the rule index. There you can view requests for rule creation, update, or deletion, which are pending approval or denial.

- **Approve:** To approve a request, click the green check button to approve or the red cross button to deny the request. A window will then appear to confirm the approval and deployment of the rule to the production environment, click *Confirm* to accept the action or *Cancel* to return to the requests.

- **Deny:** To deny a request, click the red cross button. A window will then appear to confirm the deletion, click *Confirm* to accept the action or *Cancel* to return to the requests.

## How to create rule requests?

Go to the Rule Requests tab and click Create Rule Request on the right side of the screen.

## Available actions:

- **Create:** Allows you to create a request to create a new rule.
- **Update:** Allows you to create a request to edit an existing rule. If you select this option, a list of available rules to edit will be displayed, select one and click the *Next* button, and you will be redirected to a form similar to the rule creation form.
- **Delete:** Allows you to create a request to delete an existing rule. If you select this option, a list of rules you can delete will also be displayed, then click the *Submit request* button.

## How to create new rules?

To create a new rule, select the *Create* option from the request list, and a form will be displayed.

Required fields:

- **Name:** What do you want to name the rule you are creating?
- **Action:** Refers to the function the rule will perform in the authentication process. These actions are described in detail in the *Rule actions* section of this documentation.
- **Rule type:** Refers to the type of rule you want to create, for example, a rule that validates a credit card number, a range of cards, an email, a range of BINs, etc.
- **Value:** The value required by a rule to validate and compare the rule data and the authentication request data.

## Rules with multiple conditions:

You can also add other conditions to the same rule by clicking the **Add condition** button at the bottom of the form, and new fields will be displayed to enter another rule type and its corresponding value.

  To enable this button, you must have already completed a condition with its rule type and value.

Clicking the button will display a new input form.

There are also other types of rules that offer more possibilities. In the following image, you can see a rule where you can choose the operator with which the rule values will be compared, for example, that the given value has a specific range, a minimum or maximum value.

After submitting the rule request, it will be added to the *Rule requests* list, where you have the option to *Accept* or *Deny* using the buttons on the right side.

  Until you accept the rule request, it cannot be viewed or used in production. After accepting it, remember to enable it.

## Rule actions:

When creating a rule, a specific action type is defined for it to execute. These actions allow you to define the transStatus (authentication status of the transaction).

These actions are found in the rule creation form, in the *Action* field:

The allowed actions are as follows:

- **Authenticate:** Rules with this action will validate the authentication request and automatically approve it if the data validation is successful, generating a Y status (successful authentication). For example, a *BIN range* rule will contain a minimum and maximum BIN range, and authentications with cards whose BIN falls within this range will be successfully validated and the request will be authenticated immediately.

- **Perform challenge:** Rules whose action is to perform a challenge will generate a C status (challenge required) upon validation, and the cardholder will be directed to a user interface where they will be asked to complete a challenge to verify their identity.

- **Decoupled challenge:** Rules with this action, upon validation, will generate a D status (decoupled challenge), and the authentication request will be paused, and the issuer will be responsible for manually challenging the cardholder.

- **Do not authenticate:** Rules with this action, upon validation, will automatically trigger an N status (failed authentication). The data included in these rules are usually risky.

- **Execute rule group:** Rules created with this action can execute all the rules contained in a specific rule group of the issuer. To choose this option, you must have enabled rule groups for the issuer.

  In the *Fraud control groups* section, a list of available groups will be presented, choose one and continue filling in the conditions for the rule.

- **None:** Rules with this action will take the default action and generate an N status (Not authenticated).
  The function of executing a rule group allows you to create rules that cover more validations and also allows you to use previously created rules to perform other validations or complement them with other conditions, thus grouping functionalities and reducing repeated rules.

## Rule Types

When creating a rule, you must specify its type. The available options are shown in the Rule Type field of the rule creation form.

The supported rule types are:

### Card number range rule:
Validates whether the card number in the authentication request falls within a specified range.
- Min range: At least 13 digits
- Max range: Up to 19 digits, and must be greater than the minimum

### BIN range rule:
This rule allows you to validate that the card in the authentication request is within the specified range. It accepts two values, the initial range, which must be a 6- or 8-digit BIN, and the final range, which must have the same number of digits.

### Transaction card number rule:
This rule allows you to validate that the card number entered in the value matches the card number in the authentication request. This rule requires at least 13 digits and a maximum of 19, and must match the Luhn algorithm, which checks if a card number is valid.

### Purchase amount rule:
This rule allows you to validate the amount of the transaction to be authenticated. It accepts a numeric value indicating a payment amount.

### Authentication data rule:
 This rule validates the fields sent in the AReq message, which is a type of message in the 3-D Secure Protocol that initiates the authentication process. This rule receives the following parameters:

  - **Field**, refers to the field contained in the AReq message. A list of all available fields to validate is presented. Select one.

  - **Conditions**, in this field, select the operator with which the values to be validated will be compared. Depending on the selected field, specific operators are displayed.

## Scoring rules:

### Issuer scoring rule:
This rule validates the authentication request based on the score assigned to the issuer processing the transaction. The rule allows you to assign the comparison operator with the final value you will assign.

### Historical scoring rule:
This rule validates the authentication request based on the cardholder's historical score. It is evaluated based on previous transactions. The rule allows you to assign the comparison operator with the final value you will assign.

### RBA MasterCard scoring rule:
This rule validates the authentication request based on the risk score evaluated for MasterCard. The rule allows you to assign the comparison operator with the final value you will assign.

 Available comparison operators for scoring rules:
  - **Between**, accepts a minimum and a maximum value. The authentication data must be within the range to pass validation.

  - **Less than**, accepts a value and validates that the authentication data is less than the value given in the rule.

  - **Less than or equal to**, accepts a value and validates that the authentication data is less than or equal to the value given in the rule.

  - **Greater than**, accepts a value and validates that the authentication data is greater than the value given in the rule.

  - **Greater than or equal to**, accepts a value and validates that the authentication data is greater than or equal to the value given in the rule.

  - **Equal to**, accepts a value and validates that the authentication data is equal to the value given in the rule.

## Match rules:

### Email match rule:
This rule allows you to validate if the cardholder's email received in the authentication data matches the email saved for the same cardholder in previous transactions.

It accepts one of the following two values: match (find a match) or no match (do not find a match).

### Mobile phone match rule:
This rule allows you to validate if the cardholder's mobile phone received in the authentication data matches the mobile phone saved for the same cardholder in previous transactions.

It accepts one of the following two values: match (find a match) or no match (do not find a match).

### Landline phone match rule:
This rule allows you to validate if the cardholder's landline phone received in the authentication data matches the landline phone saved for the same cardholder in previous transactions.

It accepts one of the following two values: match (find a match) or no match (do not find a match).

### Work phone match rule:
This rule allows you to validate if the cardholder's work phone received in the authentication data matches the work phone saved for the same cardholder in previous transactions.

It accepts one of the following two values: match (find a match) or no match (do not find a match).

### Device match rule:
This rule allows you to validate if the cardholder's fingerprint created in the transaction matches any fingerprint saved for the same cardholder in previous successful transactions. The fingerprint is a method that automatically records a user's identifier based on information captured with the device used to perform a transaction or digital movement.

It accepts one of the following two values: match (find a match) or no match (do not find a match).

You will find in the *Value* field a list with two options, match (find a match) or no match (do not find a match) with the data saved in ACS.

# Fraud control groups

Fraud control groups allow you to classify and group rules to perform validations for specific purposes.

For example, you can create two groups, one called *Whitelist*, where you could include card numbers and customer data with low fraud risk, and the rule actions could mostly be *Authenticate*. The other group is called *Blacklist*, where you could add card numbers and personal information associated with customers with risky histories or reports, and the rule action could be *Do not authenticate*.

## Fraud control group index:

To access the rule group index, go to the menu **Manage fraud control -> Fraud control groups**, located in the tabs at the top of an issuer's detail page.

In the following image, a list of an issuer's fraud control groups is shown. The information is organized in a table and shows the main data of the groups such as: Name, date, rules, and status.

## How to create a new rule group?

To create a group, click the **Create** button located on the right side of the group index. A form will be displayed.

In the form, just enter the name you want the group to have, then click the *Save* button.

A rule group is only executed when, upon creating a new rule, you choose the *Execute rule group* option, select the specific group, and then enable the rule.

## Group details:

To view the details of a group, click the **View** button located on the right side of the table, in front of each group.

## Enable and disable a group:
To enable or disable a group, click the right side menu in the group detail and slide the switch button to enable or disable as appropriate.

## Group rules:
At the bottom of the issuer's detail page, you will find the list of production rules for the group, listed in a table showing the rule status, name, and the action they perform upon validation.
You can enable or disable them by clicking the dropdown menu at the end of each rule. You can also view the details of each rule by pressing the button labeled *View*.

## Rule requests:
This functionality behaves the same as the *Anti-fraud control rules* request section, with the difference that rule requests made to create, update, or delete rules will be saved exclusively for the selected group.

After creating a rule request, remember to approve it and then enable it in the *Production rules* menu.
