# HTTP Status Codes in the Authentication Process

The following are HTTP status codes that may be returned during the authentication process, along with a description of their purpose within the service.

Code                      | Description
--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
200 OK                    | The request was successful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
201 Created               | The request was successful and a new resource was created as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
202 Accepted              | The request has been received but not yet processed. This is a non-committal response, meaning there is no HTTP mechanism for sending an asynchronous response indicating the outcome. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.|
400 Bad Request           | The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
401 Unauthorized          | Authentication is required to access the requested resource. Unlike 403, authentication is possible here.                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
403 Forbidden             | The client does not have the necessary permissions for the content, so the server is refusing to provide a proper response.                                                                                                                                                                  |               
404 Not Found             | The server could not find the requested content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
422 Unprocessable Entity  | The request was well-formed but could not be processed due to semantic errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
500 Internal Server Error | The server encountered an internal error and could not complete the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
502 Bad Gateway           | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
503 Service Unavailable   | The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes include server maintenance or overload.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
