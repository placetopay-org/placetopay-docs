# Profiles

To access this module, navigate to the left sidebar menu, expand the *Security* option, and select the *Profiles* section.

## Profile Index

Roles are associated with profiles, as multiple profiles can be linked to the same role. Below is an example of a profile index.

To access this module, a user with the necessary permissions to create profiles enters through the dropdown menu on the left panel, under the security tab.

Upon entering the module, the platform displays a table with the following fields: name, description, user, and the creation and update dates of the profile.

Additionally, this section includes a profile search bar in the upper left corner.

## Profile Actions

Each profile has management options such as view, edit, or disable.

**View:** Allows you to see more detailed information about the profile, such as the name, creation and update dates, the user who created it, as well as the permissions currently assigned or available to add.

  The profile detail view contains three sections:

  - **Profile Information:** Displays the profile's status, name, whether it is the current profile (i.e., the profile with which the user is logged in), whether it is enabled, as well as the creation and update dates and the users who performed these actions.

  - **Roles:** Lists the roles associated with the profile, including their name, description, and an option to view role details.

  - **ACL:** Lists the ACL permissions created for the profile, the model or entity for each permission, the rule description, and the number of exceptions, if any.

  Exceptions to an ACL rule allow a rule with the *Deny* action to permit the current profile to view only those records created with that same profile.

**Edit:** Allows you to update the profile's name and description.

  It is important to note that a profile cannot be deleted, as there may be activities performed under that profile. Deleting it could cause errors. For this reason, the application provides the option to disable the profile to deny access.

## How to Create a New Profile

To create a new profile, you must do so through an invitation.

### What is ACL?

ACL (Access Control List) is a permission and rule management module developed by PlacetoPay and used by ACS. It manages the permissions and access controls for the various roles and profiles created in ACS.

These permissions and access rules differ from the basic permissions registered in roles in that they are more specific and provide an extra layer of security for the data managed in the application. They ensure that only information relevant to a specific client is visible, preventing data from other clients or organizations from being exposed.

The list of rules can be viewed in the profile detail section.

### How to Create ACL Rules

To create an ACL rule, click the *Create* button to open a form.

#### General Information:

Rules have two available options:
- Allow access
- Deny access

In the entity field, select the entity that manages the module to which you want to apply the conditions you are about to create.

#### Conditionals:

- Attribute: Select the field corresponding to the previously selected entity that you wish to validate.
- Operator: Choose the operator to compare data.
- Value: Enter one or more values that the selected attribute should contain.

After completing the form, click the *Save* button.
