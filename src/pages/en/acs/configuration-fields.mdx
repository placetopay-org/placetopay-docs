# Issuer Configuration

## How to Access

To access this menu, click on **Configuration** in the issuer details.

At the bottom of the screen, you'll find three tabs that group issuer configuration fields into three categories: **General, Challenge Views, and Services**.

Each tab displays a table listing the configuration fields, showing the name, initial value, current status, and available actions.

## Configuration Field Categories

  - **General:** Fields in this category allow you to configure general application behaviors.

 - **Challenge Views:** Fields in this category allow you to configure user interfaces for different types of OTP (one-time code, OTP with single and multiple selection options, and out-of-band OTP).

  - **Services:** Fields in this category validate the strategies to be used for implementing ACS services such as OTP, cardholder information service, or application access and authorization services. They also include specific values for configuring each of these strategies.

  For a detailed explanation of how configuration fields and categories work, refer to the Other Settings section, under the Configuration Fields tab of this documentation.

## Actions for Issuer Configuration

To view the available actions for configuration fields, click the dropdown menu located at the end of each field.

The available actions are:

- **View:** Select to view the field configuration details.

- **Edit:** Select to edit any configuration value that was initially used to create the field.

    Edit configuration fields considering the business logic and specific issuer functionality.

- **Enable / Disable:** Toggle the switch button to enable or disable the field according to the current status.

   Note that if you disable a default field, the issuer cannot be enabled.
