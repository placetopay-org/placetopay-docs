CeroPay from Banco de Bogot√° is a digital revolving credit line that allows you to finance goods and services at partner merchants.

## CeroPay Benefits

- **Just 4 installments, with no hidden fees**: You can split your purchases or payments into 4 monthly installments.  
- **0% interest on your purchase**: No interest, maintenance fees, or insurance charges apply during the months you defer your payments (up to 4 months).  
- **No paperwork or documentation required**: The authentication process is 100% digital.  

## Use Cases  

- **Accessible credit options**: Allows you to offer financing in 4 interest-free installments, increasing average conversions by making high-value purchases more accessible.  
- **Broader customer reach**: By eliminating interest and hidden fees, CeroPay becomes an attractive option for customers who prefer installment payments without worrying about additional charges.  

## Payment Method Behavior  

CeroPay is a redirected payment method, meaning that the user will be redirected to the CeroPay portal to complete the payment process. Once finished, you will return to the payment gateway and see the final state of your transaction.

- **Integrations through**: [Webcheckout](/en/checkout), [Microsites](/en/payments/introduction-to-microsites), and [Payment Links](/en/payment-links)  
  Once users complete the payment form, they will be redirected to the CeroPay portal to finalize the payment process. After completion, they will return to the payment gateway and see the final status of their transaction.  

- **Integrations through**: [Gateway](/en/gateway)  
  Gateway integrations follow an **asynchronous process** in which a **payment session link** is provided, directing the user to the CeroPay portal to complete the payment. Once completed, they will return to the **return URL** specified in the payment session creation request.  

  To obtain the final transaction status, a request must be made to the endpoint [Query transaction by internal reference](/en/gateway/api/reference/transaction#query-request).  

## Restrictions  

- **Payer's identification type**: CeroPay only allows payer authentication through **Colombian citizenship ID (`CC`)**.  
- **Minimum and maximum amounts**: The amount that can be paid with CeroPay must be between **$100,000 and $2,000,000**.
