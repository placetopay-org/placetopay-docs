The ACH system (Automated Clearing House) is an electronic transfer network that allows funds to be moved directly between bank accounts. This system is widely used in the United States and Puerto Rico, mainly for recurring payments, payroll transfers, bill payments, and other automated financial services. {{ className: 'lead' }}

By implementing ACH in your business, you can offer your customers a secure, reliable, and low-cost payment option, improving the payment experience and optimizing processing times.

## ACH Return

An **ACH Return** occurs when a transfer or automatic debit cannot be successfully completed. For example, in Puerto Rico, although an ACH transaction may be initially approved, the actual processing of funds may take between 1 and 2 business days. During this time, the transaction can fail for various reasons, resulting in a return.

There are several reasons why an ACH debit may fail:

- **Insufficient funds**: The customer’s account does not have enough balance to complete the payment.
- **Closed account**: The customer's bank account is no longer active.
- **Incorrect information**: The account information provided is incorrect or outdated.
- **Unauthorized transaction**: The customer did not authorize the transaction.

Each return has a specific code explaining the reason for the failure. These codes help businesses quickly understand the reason for the return and take necessary actions.

## View ACH Returns in Placetopay

In Placetopay, ACH returns are easily identified and managed. Below, we explain how to review and classify these returns.

### Access to ACH Returns

You can view the status of each transaction and its associated returns in the Placetopay admin panel. You can also export this information into a downloadable file for external analysis.

For automated integrations, Placetopay also offers an API that allows external systems to check for occurred returns. This facilitates the direct integration of return information into the business’s management systems, enhancing operational efficiency.

### ACH Return codes and their meaning

Placetopay automatically generates specific return codes indicating the reason for failure in each transaction. These codes allow businesses to quickly classify issues and take appropriate actions.

**Main return codes:**

- **R01 - Insufficient funds**: The customer’s account does not have enough balance to complete the transaction.
- **R02 - Account closed**: The customer’s bank account is no longer active.
- **R03 - Unable to locate the account**: The account information provided is incorrect or outdated.

## Identify ACH Returns

To review your ACH returns in Placetopay, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Placetopay Panel** with your account and user permissions.
2. **Identify the main transaction**:
   - The transaction status will display as “APPROVED”.
   - However, the transaction type will be updated to “Reversed”, indicating it was canceled by the return and should not be counted as a completed transaction.
   - As transaction data, you will find the Account (e.g., "Personal Checking 1111") and Bank (e.g., "Banco de Puerto Rico"), which are details associated with the account.
   - In the transaction details, you will find a “Refunds List” section showing the associated return.
3. **View the return transaction**:
   - This transaction includes essential data from the original transaction, such as amount, currency, and account number.
   - As transaction data, you will find a reference to the main transaction, along with the Account and Bank details.
   - Additionally, a return code is added, specifying the reason for cancellation (e.g., R01: Insufficient funds).
   - In the “Transaction Detail” section, additional specific return data is included, such as collection ID and batch number.

## Using the API for ACH Returns

Placetopay provides an API that enables obtaining transaction reports, allowing the integration of return information into management systems without manual intervention.

### Generating report via API

To generate the report, use the [Request a report](/en/gateway/api/reference/report#report-request) endpoint with the filter type: ["CHARGEBACK"] to get the return transactions.

```json  {{ title: 'Request Example' }}
{
  "locale": "en_US",
  "auth": {
    "login": "login",
    "tranKey": "trankey",
    "nonce": "nonce",
    "seed": "2023-06-08T14:59:34-05:00"
  },
  "filters": {
    "startDate": "2023-06-07 14:59:34",
    "endDate": "2023-06-08 14:59:34",
    "type": ["CHARGEBACK"]
  },
  "callbackUrl": "https://dnetix.co/ping/report"
}
```

### Checking the generated report

Once the report is created, you can check it at the [Obtain requested report](/gateway/api/reference/report#report-obtain-request) endpoint. This report includes differentiated transactions with the type field, indicating if the transaction was a “CHARGEBACK”.

```txt

```

> This report includes basic transaction information. For more detailed information, you should check each transaction individually.

## Webhook notification for ACH Returns

In addition to reports and the API, Placetopay offers an **automatic webhook notification** to alert in real-time when an ACH return occurs on a site.

### Requesting and configuring the webhook

To enable the ACH return webhook, please contact the Placetopay operations team and provide the URL where you want to receive notifications.

### Webhook notification structure

Once enabled, when a new ACH return is generated on your site, an HTTP notification will be sent to the URL you defined for the webhook.

To learn more about how to receive and validate webhooks, visit [Gateway - Webhooks](/en/gateway/webhooks).
