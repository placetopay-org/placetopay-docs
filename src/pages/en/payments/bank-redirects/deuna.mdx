Deuna is a payment method that allows users to make instant payments directly from their mobile phones. Customers can pay in stores by scanning a QR code with the Deuna app, or by accessing the application to complete the payment using their mobile number or bank account—no cash or physical cards needed.

## Benefits of Deuna

- **Instant payments**: Users can authorize purchases within seconds using their mobile phone.
- **Flexible for desktop and mobile**: On desktop, the customer scans the QR code from the checkout page; on mobile, the process continues directly in the Deuna app.
- **No cash or cards required**: Payments are completed digitally using a QR code, mobile number, or bank account.

## Casos de uso  

- **Pagos inmediatos sin necesidad de tarjetas**: Ideal para comercios que desean ofrecer un método de pago digital basado en QR o app, permitiendo a los usuarios completar su compra rápidamente y reduciendo la fricción durante el checkout.
- **Mayor alcance de clientes que prefieren pagos desde el celular**: Al no requerir tarjetas físicas ni efectivo, Deuna se convierte en una alternativa atractiva para negocios cuyo público prefiere pagar usando su teléfono móvil o transferencias bancarias.

## Payment Method Behavior

Deuna is a redirected payment method that can operate through two different flows, depending on the device from which the user initiates the payment process. The checkout provides both the redirection link and the QR code in text format, and the integrator decides which one to use to deliver the best experience for the user:

### Payment from Desktop (QR)
When the integrator detects that the user is completing the payment from a computer, it is recommended to use the QR-based flow, as it provides the best experience for this type of device.  
The customer simply scans the QR code using the Deuna app on their mobile phone to authorize the transaction.

### Payment from Mobile Device
If the user is completing the process from their mobile phone, the ideal flow is to redirect them directly to the Deuna app to complete authentication and confirm the payment.

- **Integrations via**: [Webcheckout](/en/checkout), [Microsites](/en/payments/introduction-to-microsites), and [Payment Links](/en/payment-links)  
  Once the user completes the payment form, they are redirected to the Deuna flow, where they can continue the payment in the mobile app or scan the QR code if they are on desktop.  
  After authorizing the transaction in Deuna, the user can refresh the page or, after a few minutes, see the final status of the transaction reflected in the checkout.

- **Integrations via**: [Gateway](/en/gateway)  
  Gateway integrations are asynchronous. The checkout provides the payment session link, which allows redirecting the user to the Deuna flow to complete the transaction within the app.  
  Additionally, the checkout provides the QR code in text format so the integrator can decide how to display it when the payment is being made from a desktop device.

  To obtain the final status of the transaction, a request must be made to the endpoint **[Query Transaction by Internal Reference](/en/gateway/api/reference/transaction#query-request)**.
