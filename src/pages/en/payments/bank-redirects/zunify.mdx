Zunify is a remote authorization payment method operating in **Costa Rica**. It allows users to unify their bank accounts and other payment products within a single mobile application, ensuring security through direct user approval from the Zunify app.

## Benefits of Zunify

- **Bank Unification**: Customers choose which account to pay from within the same app.
- **Security in your hands**: Final authorization always happens on the user's mobile device.
- **Card-Free & Cashless**: A 100% digital process based on mobile number.
- **Immediate Confirmation**: The system monitors the status in real-time to update the transaction as soon as it is approved in the app.

## User Experience Flow

1. **Select payment method**: The user selects Zunify as the payment method.
2. **Complete data**: The user enters the required data in the payment form. The mandatory data for the payment method are: mobile number and PIN obtained from the Zunify app. Additional data such as ID, names, etc., are rules specific to each merchant.
3. **Request processing**: The user requests the transaction processing.
4. **Pending status**: The transaction status is displayed as pending on the Checkout page.
5. **Confirm in the app**: The user receives a push notification on their device and must open the Zunify app to confirm or reject the transaction.
6. **Final result**: Once the action is completed in the app, the transaction status is updated on the Checkout screen with the final result.

> **Note on expiration time**: The transaction must be authorized within a defined period. If the timeout is exceeded, the operation will be automatically rejected to protect the user's security.

## Payment Method Behavior

The user completes the on-screen form, the system waits for the authorization performed by the customer from their Zunify app, and once the transaction is confirmed, the final result is displayed.
