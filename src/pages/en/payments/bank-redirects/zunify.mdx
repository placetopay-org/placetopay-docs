Zunify is a digital payment network operating in **Costa Rica**. It allows users to unify their bank accounts and other payment products within a single mobile application. As an independent payment method, it ensures security through direct user approval on their mobile device.

## Benefits of Zunify

- **Bank Unification**: Customers choose which account to pay from within the same app.
- **Security in your hands**: Final authorization always happens on the user's mobile device via push notification.
- **Card-Free & Cashless**: A 100% digital process based on mobile number and ID.
- **Immediate Confirmation**: The system monitors the status in real-time to update the transaction as soon as it is approved in the app.

## User Experience Flow

The Zunify payment process consists of the following steps:

1. **Enter email**: The user starts by identifying their account at the checkout.
2. **Select payment method**: "Pay with Zunify" is selected from the options.
3. **Complete data**: The user enters their mobile phone number, security PIN, and ID number.
4. **Confirm payment on your mobile**: The customer opens their Zunify app to authorize the pending transaction.
5. **Payment Summary**: After approval, the gateway displays the final status of the operation.

> **Note on expiration time**: The transaction must be authorized within a defined period. If the timeout in the app is exceeded, the operation will be automatically rejected to protect the user's security.

## Payment Method Behavior

Zunify is a remote authorization payment method that adapts to the user's device:

### Desktop Payment
The user completes the on-screen form, and the system waits for the authorization performed by the customer on their phone.

### Mobile Device Payment
The process facilitates the transition to the Zunify app to complete validation and automatically return to the payment summary.

## Integration

- **Webcheckout, Microsites, and Payment Links**: The gateway manages the entire data capture flow and waits for the response from the Zunify network.
- **Gateway**: The integrator must capture the required data (mobile number, PIN, and ID) and send it to initiate the asynchronous request. To check the result, use the [Query Transaction](/en/gateway/api/reference/transaction#query-request) endpoint.
