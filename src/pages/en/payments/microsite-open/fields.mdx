Once inside the microsite details, click the button in the top-right corner with 3 dots and then select **“VIEW”** to enter the microsite and retrieve the URL to share. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Form Field Descriptions

Once inside the microsite, the browser URL should be shared with the customer **(it is always the same for all customers)** so they can enter the data into the standard microsite fields:

- **Reference:** This field represents the transaction reference and should ideally be unique for each payment process.
- **Payment Description:** A brief detail of the purchase.
- **Amount:** The value of the product or service.
- **Buyer's Document Number:** The document number of the final customer.
- **Buyer's First Name:** The first name of the final customer.
- **Buyer's Last Name:** The last name of the final customer.
- **Buyer's Email Address:** The email address of the final customer.

<Note> These fields must be filled out by the end customer. </Note>

The selected URL is the one that must be shared with the customer.
