Click to Pay is a digital payment solution that allows users to make online purchases faster, simpler, and more securely, without needing to manually enter their card details for each transaction. Once the card is registered in the Click to Pay profile, users can pay at participating merchants with just a few clicks, while also taking advantage of advanced security features such as tokenization and enhanced authentication. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Click to Pay Providers

Both Visa and Mastercard implement Click to Pay under the same international standard defined by EMVCo.

Each card network implements Click to Pay offering its own experience and support (for example, Click to Pay Visa and Click to Pay Mastercard), but all comply with the same SRC protocol. This ensures a uniform, interoperable, and secure experience for users and businesses, regardless of the card brand used by the cardholder.

At Placetopay, we support Click to Pay with direct integration with both providers.

- Click To Pay Visa: Uses the payment experience offered by Visa.
- Click To Pay Mastercard: Uses the payment experience offered by Mastercard.

Both options are available in WebCheckout and can be enabled in your Placetopay account.

Choosing one option over the other DOES NOT RESTRICT the payment methods that the cardholder can use, as Click to Pay is compatible with Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express cards.
