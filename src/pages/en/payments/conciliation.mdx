# Conciliation

Conciliation is a key process that ensures consistency between the payments recorded in PlacetoPay and the reports sent by payment networks or financial institutions. Its purpose is to confirm that every transaction has been processed correctly and that financial records align. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What is conciliation?

It is the verification performed between transactions received on the platform and the information reported by the banks. It ensures that amounts, dates, and payment statuses match, providing merchants with transparency and control.

This process allows you to:

- Confirm that payments were successfully processed.
- Detect and resolve discrepancies.
- Obtain clear information for financial management.

## How does it work?

PlacetoPay periodically works conciliation reports about payment networks. These reports are automatically compared with the transactions processed in PlacetoPay.

When a transaction matches the conciliation data, it is marked as **conciliated**. In case of financial inquiries, the accounting staff can identify the data for analysis and resolution.

This process is carried out automatically, enabling more efficient and reliable payment management.
