Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) is an electronic system that allows a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participant to pay for food using SNAP benefits. When a participant shops at a SNAP authorized retail store, their SNAP EBT account is debited to reimburse the store for food that was purchased.

## Payment Flow  
1. The user selects EBT as the payment method at checkout.  
2. Enters their EBT card details.  
3. Completes the OTP (one-time password) validation.
4. Placetopay processes the transaction and notifies both the merchant and the user about the transaction status.

## Integration Options  

- **Integration via**: [Webcheckout](/en/checkout)  
The **EBT** payment method is available through **Webcheckout**, providing a secure and automated payment process. **PlacetoPay** manages the transaction, ensuring a seamless user experience.  

- **Integration via**: [Gateway](/en/gateway)  
For advanced integrations, **Gateway** allows merchants to capture and process **EBT** payments directly from their platform, offering greater control in specific scenarios such as:  
- Integrations with interactive voice response (IVR) systems.  
- Processing multiple transactions using the same cardholder information. 


## Placetopay Wallet  

- EBT is compatible with Placetopay Wallet, allowing users to store their card information for quick and secure purchases without needing to enter it manually for every transaction.  

## Restrictions  

- EBT cards cannot be used at certain locations, such as liquor stores, casinos, and other gambling establishments.  

## Webcheckout Integration  
The **EBT** payment method allows merchants to accept electronic payments through **Webcheckout**, with a secure and automated process. EBT supports two types of payment: **Regular** and **Cash**, which can be used in the same transaction.
