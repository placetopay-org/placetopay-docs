## How to consult a payment order?

To consult a payment order, you will have two options. The first one is a section where a quick search can be made.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/searche_order.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

In this section, you can perform a quick search by entering the payment order number, or if you have the alternate reference, you can find the specific order you are looking for.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/search_order_payment.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Another way to search for transactions is through the filter option.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/filter_order.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Here you can perform a more advanced search since you will have more options to apply.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/filter_field_order.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

After selecting the search parameters, you need to add each of the conditions for the search filter.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/add_condition.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Once the filter parameters are selected, you need to apply the filter.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/apply_filter.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Once applied, you will be able to see the payment orders you are searching for according to the parameters you selected.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/apply_filter_order_number.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

Additionally, you can save filters in case you frequently perform searches with the same type of information. To do this, click on the "Save filter" option.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/save_filter.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

You will be asked to provide a name for the filter, assign it, and click the Ok button.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/save_filter_one.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110" 
  />
</CenteredContainer>

This filter will be visible in the saved filters section. To apply it, simply click on it and choose the apply filter option.

<CenteredContainer>
  <ImageZoom
      src="/save_filter_two.webp"
      alt="login example image"
      className="w-full h-auto shadow rounded-md my-0 transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out cursor-pointer hover:scale-110 focus:scale-110"
