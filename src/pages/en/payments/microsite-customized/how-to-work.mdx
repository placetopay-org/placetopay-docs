## How does it work? 

The **Custom Microsite** allows PlacetoPay to query an external service to obtain invoice information and manage its payment, and also allows the settlement of payments when they are processed through the platform.  
### Service Operation
1. **Authentication:**  
   - Se soportan dos tipos de autenticaci√≥n:  
     - **Web Services Security (WSS):** Uses `UsernameToken Profile 1.1`, where credentials include `login`, `tranKey`, `nonce` and `seed`.   
     - **JSON Web Token (JWT):** It is based on basic authentication with `username` and `password`, generating an `access_token` for requests. 
     - For more information about this please go to the following section [Authentication](/payments/microsite-customized/authentication).   

2. **Invoice inquiries:**  
   - This is done by `POST /invoice/search/`.  
   - Invoices can be searched by reference, payer document or alternate reference.  
   - Additional filters can be applied and payment restrictions can be defined..  
   - The response includes information such as invoice status, amounts, taxes and available payment methods..  
   - For more information about this please go to the following section [search](/payments/microsite-customized/services#busqueda-de-facturas).   

3. **Blocking and Release of Invoices:**  
   - Invoices can be blocked (`POST /invoice/hold`) to prevent payments while they are in the validation process.  
   - To unlock them, a request must be sent with the parameter `revoke: true`.  
   - For more information about this please go to the following section [hold](/payments/microsite-customized/services#bloqueo-y-liberacion-de-facturas).   

4. **Settlement of Payments:**  
   - Once the payment has been made, we send a `POST /invoice/settle/` request with the transaction details.  
   - It includes data such as invoice ID, authorization code, amount, date, payment method and internal reference.  
   - For more information about this please go to the following section [settle](/payments/microsite-customized/services#asentamiento-de-factura).   


5. **Error Handling:**  
   - A standard error structure is provided for cases such as failed authentication, settlement already done or non-existent invoice.  
   - Error messages can be translated by language [Locale](/checkout/localization).  
   - For more information about this please go to the following section [error](/payments/microsite-customized/error-handling).   


6. **Payment Method Configuration:**  
   - You can define the payment methods available per invoice.  
   - Intersection or merging of methods is allowed when multiple invoices are paid in a single transaction.  
   - For more information about this please go to the following section [paymentMethod](/payments/microsite-customized/data-structures#configuracion-de-metodos-de-pago).   


This web service is designed to integrate with any system that supports REST communication, allowing a secure and efficient payment flow.
