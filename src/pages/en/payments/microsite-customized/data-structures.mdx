# Data structure

In this section you will find the types of data and structures that you can parameterize at the time of integration with custom microsite.

## Payment methods configuration 
The **paymentMethod** parameter can be used during the query flow to restrict the payment methods available per invoice to be paid, respecting all the payment methods 
enabled on the collection site. This configuration allows to define the payment methods available per invoice in order to meet and adapt specific business needs of the merchants.

Name of the parameter             |  PaymentMethods          |
------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------     |
Data type       | array                                    |
Example values | [“visa”] ["pse," “amex”, “paypal”]       |

Note: If the parameter value is an empty list then all payment methods enabled for the site will be taken.
The available payment methods can be found in the official documentation of the payment gateway: [Payment Methods](https://docs.placetopay.dev/checkout/payment-methods). 

## Merger of payment methods (mergePaymentMethods) 
Defines whether to merge or intersect payment methods when processing multiple invoices in a single transaction. This option only applies to invoices using

If the **mergePaymentMethods:** ** **true** field is sent in the request.

This form allows you to perform the merging or joining of the set of payment methods of the selected invoices. For example:

| ID    | PaymentMethods              |  Payment methods to be sent in the transaction          |
|---------| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------     |
| 1       | [“visa”, “pse”, “amex”]    | [“visa”, "pse," “amex”, “paypal”]       |
| 2       | [“visa”, “amex”, “paypal”] | [“visa”, "pse," “amex”, “paypal”]       |

As a result **[“visa”, “pse”, “amex”, “paypal”]** will be sent because it corresponds to the combination of payment methods of each invoice.

## Restriction management with multiple payments 

When the microsite has the “Allow multiple payment orders to be paid at the same time” configuration enabled, it is possible to define the way in which the payment methods should be resolved by using the “mergePaymentMethods” option. See details in the InvoiceOptions structure.

Here is how to configure this option:

**Intersection of payment methods**.

If the field **mergePaymentMethods:** ** **false** is sent in the request 

By default, the intersection of all the payment methods of the selected invoices will be performed, thus ensuring that the payment methods of each of the selected invoices are respected. 
selected, thus ensuring that the payment methods of each of the invoices are respected. 
invoices. For example:

| ID    | Methods of payment              |  Payment methods to be sent in the transaction          |
|--------| ------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------     |
| 1       | [“visa”, “pse”, “amex”]    | [“visa”, “amex”]       |
| 2       | [“visa”, “amex”, “paypal”] | [“visa”, “amex”]       |

As a result [“visa”, “amex”] will be sent because these are the payment methods that are present in the selected invoices.
