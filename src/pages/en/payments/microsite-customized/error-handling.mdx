# Error handling 

When an error occurs in the request. The message returned in the status object will be
displayed to the user in the current flow, so it is suggested to handle messages that are
user-friendly messages.
You will have the language of the user sent in each request. [locale](/checkout/localization) which is why,
can support translations for such an error message.


```json {{'title':'Sample response'}}
{
    "status": {
    "status": "FAILED",
    "reason": 999,
    "message": "You have a pending payment process",
    "date": "2025-07-07T11:30:37-05:00"
    }
}
```
## Authentication failed

When the authentication credentials of the external service are incorrect, a failed response must be returned specifying the status as `FAILED.

``` json {{'title':'Sample response'}}
{
    "status": {
    "status": "FAILED",
    "reason": 401,
    "message": "Autenticación fallida",
    "date": "2025-07-07T11:30:37-05:00"
    }
}
```

## Settlement

For any of the following cases the service must return a failed response.

**Settlement already done**

Occurs when an invoice is already settled in the external service.   
For this case it is very important to use the reason `AP` as it allows Micrositios to identify the scenario and settle the invoice in its internal database.

```json {{'title':'Sample response'}}
{
    "status": {
    "status": "FAILED",
    "reason": "AP",
    "message": "Already paid for",
    "date": "2025-07-07T12:01:29-05:00"
    }
}
```

### Entry of non-existent invoice

Occurs when an attempt is made to post an invoice that does not exist in the external service.

``` json {{'title': 'Sample response'}}
{
    "status": {
    "status": "FAILED",
    "reason": "NF",
    "message": "No existe la factura con ese identificador",
    "date": "2025-07-07T12:13:02-05:00"
    }
}
```
