# User creation

This section provides step-by-step guidance for new users on how to register and securely access the Evertec PlacetoPay Dash platform. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Step 1 Accepting the invitation

User creation begins with an invitation sent by email. To complete registration, the user must click the Accept Invitation button included in the email.

</CenteredContainer>

When you click on the **Accept invitation** button, the system will redirect you to the account creation form, where you will be asked to fill in the following fields:

- **Email address**: Allows you to assign an email address that will be linked to the user. 

- **Name**: Allows you to assign a name to the user you are creating.

- **Password**: Allows you to set a password, which will allow access to our Dash.

- **Password confirmation**: Allows you to confirm the password entered in the previous field.

The system should redirect you to the screen where you will receive a code via email, which you must copy into this section.

After completing the login information, click on the reCaptcha validation. If necessary, complete the challenge to continue, then click on the **Validate Code** button.  

## Step 2 Setting up two-factor authentication (2FA)

Below is the information corresponding to two-factor authentication, which must be completed in order to access Dash. You will be given two options:
- Log in using a code sent by email.
- Log in using an authentication app.

![configuration2fa](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/newuser/configuration2fa.webp)

If you select the **Code to your email** option, you will receive a message in your email and, after verifying the code, you will be able to log in to the Panel. [Login](/payments/newpanel/users/createuser/#step-3-login-to-the-dash).

![2faemail](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/newuser/2faemail.webp)

If you select the **Authentication App** option, you will see the following options:

- Download one of the suggested applications (Validate the following image) 

![2faapp](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/newuser/2faapp.webp)

- Scan the QR code with the downloaded application. 

![confirmation2faapp](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/newuser/confirmation2faapp.webp)
- Finally, enter the code generated in the app after scanning the QR code.

- Click on the **Validate code** button to complete the process.

<Note type="error"> If you want to change the authentication method, you can click on the “Choose another way to authenticate” option before confirming the selected method. </Note>

Once the two-factor authentication verification is successfully confirmed, the recovery codes that can be used in case you are unable to successfully perform two-factor authentication using the authentication applications should be displayed on the screen.  

There is a **Download** button, which allows you to download the codes. It is recommended that you save them in a safe place so that they can be used if necessary.

Once authorization is complete, the **Dash** corresponding to the created user should open, displaying the initial Dashboard.

## Step 3 Logging in to Dash

To access the Dash, click on the corresponding link in your browser. The following fields should appear on the screen:
- Email address
- Password

![loginnewpanel](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/newuser/loginhomeen.webp)

Once you have completed the fields, click on the **Log in** button to access the system.  

A message requesting the authentication code (2FA authentication code) to access the system should appear on the screen, followed by the field to enter it.  

You have the option to mark this device as trusted so that you will not be asked for authentication again when you try to log in from the same device.  

Once you have entered the code provided in the authentication application, click on the **Log in** button. 

![confirmacionotp](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/newuser/authenticate.webp)

Upon successful authentication, the system grants access to the **Dashboard**.

## Recover password

<Note type="error"> We recommend checking that your credentials are correct and trying again before resetting your password. </Note>

If you forget your password, you can use the **Forgot your password** option to reset it.

![loginnewpanel](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/newuser/loginhomeen.webp)

Enter your email address and click on the reCaptcha validation. If necessary, complete the challenge to continue, then click on the **Send link** button.
