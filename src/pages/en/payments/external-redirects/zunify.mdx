Zunify is a remote authorization payment method operating in **Costa Rica**. It allows users to unify their bank accounts and other payment products within a single mobile application, ensuring security through direct user approval from the Zunify app.

## Benefits of Zunify

- **Bank Unification**: Customers choose which account to pay from within the same app.
- **Security in your hands**: Final authorization always happens on the user's mobile device.
- **Card-Free & Cashless**: A 100% digital process based on mobile number.
- **Immediate Confirmation**: The system monitors the status in real-time to update the transaction as soon as it is approved in the app.

## Use Cases

- **Frictionless payments for e-commerce**: Ideal for online merchants looking to offer a fast and secure payment method, where customers authorize directly from their mobile phone without entering card details.
- **Greater reach to banked customers**: By allowing payments from multiple bank accounts unified in a single app, Zunify becomes an attractive alternative for users who prefer to pay directly from their bank.
- **Fraud reduction in transactions**: Dual authentication through PIN and confirmation in the user's app ensures that only the account holder can authorize the payment.

## Payment Method Behavior

1. **Select payment method**: The user selects Zunify as the payment method.
2. **Complete data**: The user enters the required data in the payment form:
   - Mobile number
   - PIN obtained from the Zunify app
3. **Request processing**: The user requests the transaction processing.
4. **Pending status**: The transaction remains in pending status while awaiting authorization.
5. **Confirm in the app**: The user receives a push notification on their device and must open the Zunify app to confirm or reject the transaction.
6. **Final result**: Once the action is completed in the app, the transaction status is updated to the final result.

> **Note on expiration time**: The transaction must be authorized within a defined period. If the timeout is exceeded, the operation will be automatically rejected to protect the user's security.
