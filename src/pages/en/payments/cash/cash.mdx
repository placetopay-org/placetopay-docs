Allows users to pay in cash at more than 1,400 locations across Colombia, including supermarkets, financial institutions, banks, and banking correspondents.

## Payment Flow  

1. During the payment process, the customer receives a PDF document with the details and instructions needed to complete the transaction.  
2. The customer must present the document at an authorized payment location and make the cash payment.  
3. Once the payment is confirmed, the transaction is automatically processed, and both the merchant and the user receive a notification of the completed operation.
