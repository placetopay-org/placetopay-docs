# Logging in and out of the software

## Login
The system allows territorial entity officials to log in to the application with predetermined profiles so that each has access only to the information necessary to perform their duties.

Once inside the software, to log in, click **"Are you an administrator? Click here"**.

The system will open the login form, where you enter your email address and password, and click **"Login"**.

# Logout
There are several ways to log out of the system.

* The safest way is to select the icon in the upper right corner of the window, where a list appears as shown below, and then select the option **Logout**.
* You can log out by closing the browser tab or closing the browser itself. However, your session will not be automatically closed. This creates a security breach because it's possible that your session may remain open. It's always recommended to log out using the first option.
