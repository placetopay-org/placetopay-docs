# Actions
The administrator will have access to several modules that allow them to manage the system, create and manage other users, and perform various actions.

<Note>
    It is important to note that the administrator will not be able to create, cancel, authorize, or pay declared taxes. The administrator user will only be able to view and download tax returns.
</Note>

The following explains how the system works without modifying permissions and how these permissions can be edited to change the default system settings.

## Companies
The companies module allows you to manage organizations and the tax-paying users that belong to them. You can also define the permissions these users will have within the company.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/companies.png"/>

The actions are:

### Create

To create a company within the system, click **Create Company** located in the upper right corner of the module, above the table or list.

The form will then open with the data to register the company. Enter all the requested data and finish by clicking **Save**.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/companies_options_create.png"/>

**It is important to note:**

- *A company can have several types of associated declarations*
- *An inactive company cannot use the platform's features*
- *Two companies cannot have the same document number in the system*

### View
The **View** action will display detailed company information and allow you to perform other actions.

To view a record, press the **View** action, located in the **"Options"** column of the table or list.

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/companies_option_show.png"/>
The company's basic information will be displayed, and tabs will be available from which you can: create another company, edit an existing one, create authorization files, associate users, and add declarants for the company (These actions will be explained later).
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/companies_options_view_tabs.png"/>

**Create authorization files:** This document type allows system administrators to create and manage users. The file type must be: pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, jpeg, jpg, bmp, png or tiff.

When a user is associated with a company, it is possible to add a document that supports linking that user to the organization by selecting the support file.

### Edit
This action will allow you to modify the data entered when creating the company.

To edit a record, click **Edit**, located in the **"Options"** column of the table or list.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/companies_option_edit.png"/>

The same form used to create the company will open, with the fields already filled in. You can modify and save the changes there.

### Associate Authorized User
This action allows you to define the users who will have access to certain functions within the company. To associate a user with a company, they must first be created in the Authorized Users module.

To link a user to a company that was previously created in the system, click **Authorized User** located in the **"Options"** column of the table or list.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/companies_option_user.png"/>

The list of already associated users will open.

To associate a user, press the **Associate Authorized User** button.

The form for adding the user will be enabled. From the same form, you can define the user's role or position within the company. This could be a tax auditor, a public accountant, or others. You can also determine whether or not the user has permission to authorize declarations for that company.

Enter the information and save the entry by clicking **Save**.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/associate_user_form.png"/>

<Note>
    It's important to note that this is where all the declarations they must submit within a company are associated with a user.
</Note>

<Note>
   To complete the registration and access the system, the user must be associated with at least one income type.
</Note>

<Note>
    It is also important to note that for the same number of declarants as the declaration settings in the **Number of authorizations required** field, the company must associate the same number of users with **declaration authorizer** privileges with the corresponding position, such as:

    - *Fiscal Auditor and/or*
    - *Public Accountant*
    - *Legal Representative*

    In this same order, the declaration can be signed so that payment can be made by a legal representative, unless only one person is configured in the **Number of authorizations required**, where anyone with **declaration authorizer** privileges can pay. Otherwise, the system will not allow the declarant to make the payment.
</Note>

Once the record is saved, the system will send an email to the user. From there, the user must log in and click **Complete registration**.

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/asso_bidder_registration_email.png"/>
The user must enter the registration information and create a password. The password will allow them to log in and will also be requested when performing actions on the company's declarations. It is clarified that the user will not be able to log in to the system until they are associated with at least one company and one income. To finish, the user must press **Complete Registration**.

If the user was already associated with a company, they will not be prompted to create another password when completing the registration process. Instead, they will be directed to log in with the password they created when they first associated with a company.

For more information about user registration, [see the declarant user documentation](/selfdeclarations/declarant-user/actions).

If we return to the list of already associated users, we can see other actions available for those users within the company:

- **Reset password:** Clicking this action will send an email to the email address associated with the user, allowing them to reset their password.
- **Activate/Deactivate user:** This action deactivates a user's functions within the company. If the user is associated with other companies, they can continue to perform their functions in companies where they are not deactivated.
- **View user details:** This action will display a window with the associated user's main information and their permissions within the company.
- **Edit record:** This action will allow the user to modify the associated user's information or permissions.
- **Delete record:** This action will only be available if the user has not completed registration. This option will delete the record and will not allow the user to complete the process, even if they have received the email.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/associate_user_options.png"/>

## Authorized Users
This module allows you to manage the users who will later be associated with companies.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/bidders.png"/>

Within the module, you can perform the following functions:

### Create
To create declaring or authorized users, go to the top right corner and click **Create Authorized User**.

The system will enable the form to register the user's information.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/bidders_create_form.png"/>

Once the information is completed, click **save** to create the user. Please note that created users will not be accessible until they are associated with a company.

### Reset Password
This option will be available for all created users, but if the password is reset for a user who is not yet associated with a company, they will not be able to log in until they are associated.

To reset the password, the user must click the **Reset Password** option, located in the **"Options"** field of the table or list.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/bidders_options.png"/>

Click **Confirm** in the alert pop-up window.

An email will be sent to the user's associated email address with the option to **Reset Password**.

The system will open a form. Enter the information and click the **Confirm Password Reset** button.

### View
Allows you to access detailed user information. This is accessed from View, located in the "Options" field of the table or list.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/bidders_options.png"/>

### Edit
This action allows you to modify the data with which the user was initially created. When a user is blocked due to excessive password attempts, for example, they can be unblocked from the user status field.

This can be accessed by clicking the **edit (pencil)** action, which is located in the **"Options"** field of the table or list.

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/bidders_options.png"/>
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/bidders_options_edit_form.png"/>

### Delete
This action will allow you to delete a created user as long as they are not associated with a company. When the user is associated with a company, this option will be disabled.

To delete a record, click the **Delete Record** action, located in the **"Options"** column of the table or list.

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/bidders_options.png"/>
When you click the action, an alert message will appear to confirm the action. Click **Confirm** to complete the deletion of the selected record.

## Upload Files
This module allows you to create a group of authorized users or companies using a flat file.

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/file_uploads.png"/>
To upload a file, select the **Upload Flat File** option.

The form will open from which you can select the file to upload. Document requirements will vary depending on whether you need to create companies or users.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/load_file_form.png"/>

Select the file that should contain the following fields according to what you want to create:

## List of declarations
In the list of declarations, you can find the types of declarations that companies have created. These lists will have the same actions available.

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/all_incomes_taxes_lists.png"/>

<Note>
    The administrator does not have permissions to create, edit, approve, or pay declarations. The administrator will only be able to view and download the declarations in PDF format.
</Note>

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/all_incomes_company_register.png"/>

<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/all_incomes_options.png"/>

## Parameterization
This module allows the administrator to configure the system's parameters as desired. It is important to note that this configuration will be applied to all associated companies, meaning all companies will have the same settings, and making changes will affect all companies.

### General Settings
Here you can configure general parameters, such as:

- **Currency Type:** The currency used by the system.
- **User Auto-Unlock Time:** The time after which a locked user is automatically unlocked.
- **Inactivity Lockout Time:** After remaining inactive in the system for this estimated time, the system will automatically log you out.

    <img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/security_api_edit_form.png"/>

### Roles and Permissions
This module allows you to manage different types of roles and their permissions. It is important to note that only administrator users can have these roles and their respective permissions; declaring users cannot be assigned these roles within the system.
<img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/security_roles_permissions.png"/>

- **Create:**
    To create a record, click **Create Roles**, located in the upper right corner, above the table or list. A screen will open requesting the data to create the role. After entering the data, save the information to complete the creation.
    <img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/security_roles_permissions_options_create_form.png"/>

- **View:**
    This option allows you to perform different actions. To view a record, click the **View** action, located in the **"Options"** column of the table or list. A screen with several tabs will open:

        - In the first tab, you can see the basic information about the role in detail.
        <img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/security_roles_permissions_options_view_rol.png"/>

        - In the second tab, the following actions will be available:
            - **Add a permission:** Click the search box next to the **Add** button, then select the permission(s), and then click the **Add** button. Clicking the button will automatically save the changes and display the added permissions in the records in the table or list.
            - **Deactivate or activate a role permission:** In the **"Options"** column, there is an action called **Deny?**. Clicking on this action disables that permission within the role and changes the action to **Enable?**. Clicking on it reactivates the role permission.
            - **Delete a permission:** This action, unlike the previous one, does not activate or deactivate it, but rather deletes the permission from the user. This action is recommended when you know that the user will not need that permission again. If you know that the permission will likely be needed again soon, it is better to use the **Disable?/Enable?** action.
        <img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/security_roles_permissions_options_view_permissions.png"/>

        - The third tab displays all the users associated with that role.
        <img src="/Selfdeclarations/Admin_user/security_roles_permissions_options_view_users.png"/>

## Action Log
This module allows the user to view in detail all actions performed in the system by any type of user, for example, what a user performed in the system, when, whether changes or queries were made, among others.
