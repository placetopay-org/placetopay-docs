# Selfdeclarations API
**Version**: 1.0.0

---

System that allows territorial entities to collect different types of income that taxpayers can self-declare. For this purpose, taxpayers or declarant users can complete, electronically sign, and pay the tax submitted through Placetopay's webcheckout payment platform.

The steps to keep in mind when integrating national income tax returns into the self-reporting system are detailed below.

## 1. Integration of the income-request-aio method:
This method creates the return request. When the response is successful, it must be stored, as the link received will complete the creation of the return on the self-reporting platform (if the link is not entered, it will not be possible to view it on the platform). The requestId field will be used to query return information.

## 2. Integration of the information-request method:
This method allows you to query return information (signatures, payment status and information, and return status). The query to this method must be made with the requestId obtained in the income-request-aio method. The system must query the declaration information through a probe process that must be executed with a 1-hour iteration. It should only be queried if the declarations do not have an "approved" payment status. If the declaration does not require payment (payment value = 0), no probe process should be performed; the declaration status will be "Submitted."

## 3. Income-pdf method integration:
This method allows you to obtain the PDF of the declaration. The request is made with the requestId obtained from the income-request-aio method. The resulting PDF will be a base64-encoded string; therefore, it must be decoded during the integration performed by the municipal entity.

<Note>
    Every connection process via API must comply with the integration of the three methods mentioned above, as this involves a certification step where the following aspects are validated:

    * Creation of declarations
    * Signature of declarations with one user (legal representative only) and with two users (legal representative and one other)
    * Proof of payment of declarations
    * Viewing of payment summary according to the different payment statuses
    * Synchronization of information between self-declarations and the municipal platform (integration of the information-request method)
    * Viewing the PDF from the municipal platform or sending it to the declaring user
</Note>
