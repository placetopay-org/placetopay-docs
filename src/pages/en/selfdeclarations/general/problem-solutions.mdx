# Troubleshooting
Below are some scenarios that may arise during user registration, primarily situations where an email is sent to the user and they are unable to log in.

1. If the user clicks Complete Registration and is not redirected to the system, it is recommended to copy the URL shown in the image and paste it into their browser to be redirected to the system.

2. If the user has connection issues when selecting the Go to my profile button, they can copy the URL shown in the image into their browser to access it.

3. If a user forgets their password, they can reset it by clicking Forgot your password? on the login screen.

Enter the user's registered email address, click Reset, and the system will send an email to reset the password.

4. When a message is generated that prevents you from completing a declarant's registration:

> Oops! Something is wrong, please check your information.

This indicates that some of the information on the form is incorrect. Please note that the authorized user must be associated with the company for the specific return selected on the form. If the user exists but does not have permission for the specific income, they will not be able to complete the process.

5. When you need to make a payment and the declaration has not been authorized for electronic signature because it is not visible, you should contact your system administrator to enable the option.
