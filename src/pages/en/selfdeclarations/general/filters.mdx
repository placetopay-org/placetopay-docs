# Filters

In all software modules, you will find several lists with different data tables. You can apply filters to these tables, including:

## Type in the system search box:
You can type any data found in the records or tables and press Enter to search. The system will display records with fields or data similar to what you typed.

## Advanced Search:
You can perform an advanced search by clicking the magnifying glass in the upper right corner and filter all records by their fields, selecting them, and clicking Filter.

After filtering, if you want to view all the records again, you can click Clear and then Filter again.

## Number of records per page and page switching:
Lists will have a page system where you can choose how many records are displayed per page by selecting Records per page at the top of the table or list.

You can also move forward or backward between pages by selecting at the bottom of the tables or lists.
