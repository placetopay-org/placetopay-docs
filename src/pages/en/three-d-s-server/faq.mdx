# Frequently Asked Questions About 3DSS API Functionality

In this section, you will find answers to questions and solutions to potential issues you may encounter when using 3DSS.

## What does 3DSS stand for?

The acronym **3DSS** in the EMVCo 3DS (3D Secure) protocol stands for **Three-Domain Secure Server** or **3D Secure Server**. This server is one of the key components within the 3D Secure protocol ecosystem, which is used to securely authenticate cardholders during online payment transactions.

## Why is 3DSS necessary?

The 3DSS enables communication between the authentication requestor—such as a payment gateway—and the Directory Server, which in turn communicates with another key 3-D Secure component (ACS). Therefore, 3DSS is essential because it initiates the authentication flow, sends the authentication request for processing, and subsequently returns the authentication response to the requestor.

## Why should a cardholder be authenticated?

The authentication process helps reduce the risk of fraud in online transactions by verifying the cardholder’s account, confirming their identity, and validating the transaction and personal information provided.

## How is the cardholder authentication process configured?

The **3-D Secure Protocol** defines and outlines the infrastructure and guidelines for authenticating the cardholder during an e-commerce transaction.
