# Introduction

3DS Placetopay is a service by [Evertec, Inc](https://www.evertecinc.com) that enables acquirers to enroll merchants and route transactions through the EMV® 3DS protocol. This service allows for user authentication, thereby reducing merchants' exposure to chargebacks. Using 3DS Placetopay can increase the security and efficiency of online transactions.

This documentation is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the **3DS Server** (3DSS) protocol and how it can be effectively integrated into your platform. It consists of two main sections:

1. **[Overview:](/three-d-s-server)** This section provides a detailed summary of the **3DS Server** protocol, including its purpose, how it works, and the benefits it offers to online transaction security.

2. **[API:](/three-d-s-server/api)** Here, you will find all the technical information needed to integrate the **3DS Server** protocol into your systems. This section is aimed at developers and technical teams who want to implement the features quickly and securely.

## Supported Networks

3DSS Placetopay is certified under **EMV® 3DS 2.2.0** with the following programs:

|                           | EMV® 3DS 2.2.0 |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Visa Secure               | **Supported**  |
| Mastercard Identity Check | **Supported**  |
| American Express SafeKey® | **Supported**  |
| Discover ProtectBuy       | **Supported**  |
| Diners ProtectBuy         | **Supported**  |
| ELO (Brazil)              | **Supported**  |

**Note:** "Supported" means the network is fully integrated and functional. "In progress" indicates that integration is underway and expected to be available soon.

We are currently in the process of obtaining certification for **EMV® 3DS 2.3.1**, expected to be completed in early 2025.

## About this Document

This document initially explains what the 3DS protocol is and provides the basic information needed to understand the authentication process in the 3DS Server.

It details how to configure the application from the admin console, the available features, and how security and permissions are managed. It also presents the 3DS Server flow in the cardholder authentication process.

The API section defines the service endpoints, required fields and their specifications, along with examples of requests and responses. It also includes test card data and their expected behaviors.

This document also covers terms and definitions, error codes, HTTP status codes, and the possible outcomes of an authentication. A Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section is included to resolve common issues and questions.

The information contained in this document is intended to be useful and understandable for both Evertec Placetopay collaborators and merchants interested in integrating with this service.

4. **Authentication Result:** Once the authentication process is completed, the ACS sends a message with the result back to the acquirer's 3DS server. The result may indicate a successful authentication, an attempted authentication, or a failed authentication.

5. **Transaction Completion:** The merchant receives the authentication result and proceeds to complete the transaction. If authentication was successful, the merchant requests payment authorization from the issuing bank. If authorization is approved, the transaction is completed and payment is made.

6. **Confirmation:** Finally, the cardholder receives confirmation of the transaction, either through the merchant's website or app, or via notification or email.

This process helps protect against unauthorized use of credit cards online by providing an additional layer of security and authentication.

We invite you to explore our detailed [API Section](/three-d-s-server/api), where you’ll find all the technical information needed to quickly and securely integrate the **3DS Server Placetopay** service into your environment.

This section is especially designed for developers and technical teams looking to make the most of Evertec Placetopay’s capabilities.

The information in this document is designed to be useful and understandable for both Evertec Placetopay collaborators and merchants interested in integrating with the service.
