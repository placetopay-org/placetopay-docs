# HTTP Status Codes in the Authentication Process

The following are HTTP status codes that may occur during the authentication process, along with a description of their purpose within the service.

Code                      | Description                                                                                     |
--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
200 OK                    | The request was successful.                                                                     |
201 Created               | The request was successful and resulted in the creation of a new resource.                      |
202 Accepted              | The request has been received but not yet acted upon. This is a non-committal request, meaning HTTP has no mechanism to send an asynchronous response indicating the result. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing. |
400 Bad Request           | The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.                              |
401 Unauthorized          | Authentication is required to get the requested response. Similar to 403, but here authentication is possible. |
403 Forbidden             | The client does not have access rights to the content; the server is refusing to authorize the request. |
404 Not Found             | The server cannot find the requested resource.                                                  |
422 Unprocessable Entity  | The request was well-formed but could not be followed due to semantic errors.                  |
500 Internal Server Error | The server encountered an internal error and cannot return a response.                         |
502 Bad Gateway           | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server. |
503 Service Unavailable   | The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes include maintenance or overload.   |
