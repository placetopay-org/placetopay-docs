# Session

The term **"Session"** refers to the authentication request in the context of 3DS. To carry out a successful authentication request, it is essential to create a session that meets the specifications and requirements of the 3DS protocol. You can find the details in [API - Start Session](/en/three-d-s-server/api/sessions) and in [Session API Rules to Consider](/en/three-d-s-server/api/sessions/rules)

**Authorization:** Refers to the essential authorization method with our API to make requests. This method is based on **Bearer Token**. For more information, see [Authentication](/en/three-d-s-server/api/integration/authorization).

**Create Session:** When sending a request to create a session, 3DS Placetopay checks that the card range is compatible with the 3DS protocol **where it verifies the protocol version it supports**. Once the verification is completed, it responds by providing the URL where the redirect will be performed to complete the authentication process.

<Note>
    The session has a duration of 15 minutes, during which the user must be redirected (redirectURL).
</Note>

### Available authentication types

The session types presented below are payment transaction sessions. This means that the 3DS Requestor Authentication Indicator field has a value of 01 **Payment transaction**

## Standard interaction

A basic authentication session refers to the process by which a single payment transaction is authenticated.

#### Example

```json
{
  "acctNumber": "4009000000502",
  "cardExpiryDate": "2902",
  "purchaseAmount": "10",
  "redirectURI": "https://www.placetopay.com/web",
  "purchaseCurrency": "USD",
  "reference": "AUTH_001"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "sessionToken": "d801d6f4993fc2efd3aff71a162f33888c19282e4686bd50ff4b8624e1527dbc",
  "redirectURL": "https://3dss.placetopay.com/threeds/v2x/sessions/571/d801d6f4993fc2efd3aff71a162f33888c19282e4686bd50ff4b8624e1527dbc",
  "transactionID": 580
}
```

_Example of an error message_

### "Unauthenticated" message

```json
{
  "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

This message can appear in the following cases:

- The token does not exist.
- The token has expired.

## Non-payment (NPA)

Non-payment authentications refer to transactions that need authentication but are not directly linked to a purchase or payment operation. These may include, for example, adding a credit card to a digital wallet, verifying the cardholder's identity without performing a monetary transaction.

This option does not require verifying account funds.

### Required fields:

**Authentications that will be done by browser:**
- **messageCategory:** NPA (02), Non-payment transaction.

- **deviceChannel:** BRW (02), Browser. If not sent, the platform will add it by default with this value.

- **threeDSAuthenticationInd:** The options are: ADD_CARD (04), MAINTAIN_CARD (05) and CARDHOLDER_VERIFICATION_AS_PART_OF_EMV_TOKEN_IDV (06)

- **threeDSChallengeInd:** CHALLENGE_REQUESTED_REQUESTOR_PREFERENCE (03) (Challenge is requested from the 3DS Requestor) Indicates that the 3DS Requestor's preference is that the challenge be performed **this field is optional but recommended to include**.

**Authentications that will be done by RI (Requestor Information):**
- **messageCategory:** NPA (02), Non-payment transaction.

- **deviceChannel:** RI (03).

- **threeRIInd:** The options are: 03 (Add card), 04 (Maintain card) and 05 (Verify account)

## Prior information

This type of information refers to sharing prior information during the authentication process to facilitate a more informed risk assessment and more accurate decision-making by the card issuer. The information that is added is always the last successful authentication that occurs at the same merchant.

The Placetopay 3DS Server has the following options:

### Option 1. Request to add prior information.

- **addPriorInformation:** if a request to create a session is sent with this field with value **Y**, it will be the Placetopay 3DS Server who automatically adds the necessary fields.

### Example:
```json
{
  "addPriorInformation": "Y",
  "acctNumber": "4009000000502",
  "cardExpiryDate": "2902",
  "purchaseAmount": "10",
  "redirectURI": "https://www.placetopay.com/web",
  "purchaseCurrency": "USD",
  "reference": "AUTH_001"
}
```

### Option 2. Send the fields in the request.

In this option, the 3DS Requestor will be responsible for sending the data.

- **threeDSRequestorPriorAuthenticationInfo:** Object that encapsulates the required information.

- **threeDSReqPriorAuthMethod:** Method that was used by the cardholder for authentication. **FRICTIONLESS_AUTHENTICATION** (01) frictionless, **CARDHOLDER_CHALLENGE_OCCURRED** (02) with friction

- **threeDSReqPriorAuthTimestamp:** Date and time in UTC format of the prior authentication. The format is YYYYMMDDHHMM

- **threeDSReqPriorRef:** The ID granted by the ACS in the prior transaction.

### Example:
```json
{
  "acctNumber": "4009000000502",
  "cardExpiryDate": "2902",
  "purchaseAmount": "10",
  "redirectURI": "https://www.placetopay.com/web",
  "purchaseCurrency": "USD",
  "reference": "AUTH_001",
  "threeDSRequestorPriorAuthenticationInfo": {
    "threeDSReqPriorAuthMethod": "CARDHOLDER_CHALLENGE_OCCURRED",
    "threeDSReqPriorAuthTimestamp": "202308172252",
    "threeDSReqPriorRef": "882a6ce6-7ea2-41e5-aad7-4b6d84a942f6"
  }
}
```

## Decoupled

Decoupled authentications are those in which the cardholder authentication and transaction authorization do not occur at the same time.

This method is especially relevant for use cases such as subscriptions or deferred payments, where the payment commitment is made in advance, but the transaction is completed at a later time.

### Fields:

***The values are optional, if not sent, the ACS will make the decision whether to perform decoupled challenge authentication and how long it should take.***

- **threeDSRequestorDecReqInd:** Indicates whether the 3DS Requestor requests the ACS to use Decoupled Authentication and accepts using Decoupled Authentication if the ACS confirms its use. Options **Y** if decoupled challenge is preferred and **N** to not use decoupled authentication.

- **threeDSRequestorDecMaxTime:** Indicates the maximum amount of time that the 3DS requestor will wait for an ACS to provide the results of a decoupled authentication transaction **in minutes**.

***The value of **threeDSRequestorDecMaxTime** must be between 1 and 10080***

### Example:

```json
{
  "threeDSRequestorDecReqInd": "Y",
  "threeDSRequestorDecMaxTime": "5",
  "acctNumber": "4009000000502",
  "cardExpiryDate": "2902",
  "purchaseAmount": "10",
  "redirectURI": "https://www.placetopay.com/web",
  "purchaseCurrency": "USD",
  "reference": "AUTH_001"
}
```

- **deviceChannel:** BRW (02), Browser. If not sent, the platform will add it by default with this value.

- **threeDSAuthenticationInd:** RECURRING_TRANSACTION (02)

- **threeDSChallengeInd:** CHALLENGE_REQUESTED_REQUESTOR_PREFERENCE (03) (Challenge is requested from the 3DS Requestor) Indicates that the 3DS Requestor's preference is that the challenge be performed **this field is optional but recommended to include**.

- **recurringFrequency:** Indicates the number of days between authorizations.

- **recurringExpiry:** Date when the subscription will end. The format is Ymd, example: 20250601.
