# DAF: Digital Authentication Framework

Visa Digital Authentication Framework (DAF) is a message extension of the 3DS protocol that allows Visa to identify cardholders who have completed the challenge authentication flow at a specific merchant-acquirer, thereby granting them a trusted status by determining them as an **authenticated credential payment**. This enables subsequent transactions performed by the cardholder at the same merchant to be authenticated immediately. The main goal is to reduce fraud and friction.

## Session with Digital Authentication Framework

<Note>
Acquirers must register merchants in Visa Online and configure the ***Visa Merchant ID (VMID)*** in the 3DS Server panel.
</Note>

### Required fields:

- **billAddrCity:** City of the cardholder's billing address.

- **billAddrCountry:** Country of the cardholder's billing address.

- **billAddrLine1:** Cardholder's billing address.

- **billAddrPostCode:** Postal code of the cardholder's billing address.

- **billAddrState:** State/department of the cardholder's billing address.

- **email:** Cardholder's email address.

- **mobilePhone:** Cardholder's mobile phone number.
