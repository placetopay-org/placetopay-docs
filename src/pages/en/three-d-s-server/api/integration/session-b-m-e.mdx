# BME: Bridging Message Extension


3DS **v2.3** introduces data elements in the message extension that may duplicate those present in 3DS **v2.1 and v2.2** versions, but with new or different values. According to the Basic Specification **v2.3**, these values are set in the message extension, while in **v2.1 and v2.2** they are found in the core part of the 3DS messages. In these cases, the value of the data element in the message extension prevails over the corresponding value in the core part of the 3DS message. Additionally, the 3DS Server generates the AReq message **v2.1** or **v2.2** under the assumption that the ACS does not support the Bridging Message Extension, and subsequently provides the additional information through said extension. If the Bridging Message Extension is supported, the 3DS component must be compatible with at least one of the data objects ***such as recurring data, challenge data, additional data, or file URL data*** in the message extension and implement the corresponding requirements of the Basic Specification **v2.3**.

## Session with Bridging Message Extension

To improve the approval rate in authentications, we have extended this requirement by creating the BMS extension. This extension facilitates access to information available in protocol version **2.3.1** that was not accessible in previous versions **2.1.0 and 2.2.0**. In this way, both the ACS and the directory server can make more informed decisions.

### Specifications

| BME Version | Mastercard    | Visa          |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Version 2.0 | **Supported** | **Supported** |

**Transaction with initial BME**

In this version, we will make several elements available in the session API that you can send to optimize the use of this extension.

**cardSecurityCode:** Security code associated with credit or debit cards.

**threeDSRequestorAuthenticationInd:** Authentication indicator requested by 3DS.

**threeRIInd:** Indicates the type of **3RI** requested. This data element provides additional information to the ACS to determine the best approach to deliver a 3RI request.

**transChar:** Indicates to the ACS specific transactions identified by the Merchant.

See more details in [Rules to consider for the session API](/en/three-d-s-server/api/sessions/rules)

***The Extension will only be created if it is sent in the session request bridgingMessageExtension***

<Note>
    Important: The specific values of the fields may vary depending on the implementations and requirements of each payment processor. These examples are a general guide to illustrate the concepts.

## Additional data for a recurring transaction

### Recurring Transaction Attributes

The recurring transaction attributes for **BME** are valid if the value of the `threeRIInd` field is equal to any of the following:

- **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (02)
- **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (03)

When any of these values is the indicator in `threeRIInd`, the following rules apply for the recurrence indicators on the base request data:

**Data Associated with the BME Extension**

The following data will be associated with the **BME** extension according to the previously mentioned indicators:

### 1. `recurringAmount`

The `recurringAmount` field will be added to the **BME** extension in the recurrence data section under the following conditions:

- **Condition 1**: The value of `recurringInd.amountInd` is equal to **FIXED_FREQUENCY**.

**AND**

- **Condition 2**: The value of `threeDSAuthenticationInd` is equal to: **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (02), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (03) or the value of `threeRIInd` is equal to **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (01), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (02).

If the above conditions are met, the value of `recurringAmount` will be added to the **BME** extension. The value of `recurringAmount` will be taken from the `purchaseAmount` field in the base request.


### 2. `recurringCurrency`

The `recurringCurrency` field will be added to the **BME** extension under the following conditions:

- **Condition**: The value of `threeDSAuthenticationInd` is equal to: **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (02), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (03) or the value of `threeRIInd` is equal to **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (01), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (02).

When this condition is met, the value of `recurringCurrency` will be added to the **BME** extension, and will correspond to the value provided in the base request under the `purchaseCurrency` field.


### 3. `recurringExponent`

The `recurringExponent` field will be added to the **BME** extension under the following conditions:

- **Condition 2**: The value of `threeDSAuthenticationInd` is equal to: **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (02), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (03) or the value of `threeRIInd` is equal to **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (01), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (02).

When this condition is met, the value of `recurringExponent` will be added to the **BME** extension, and will correspond to the value provided in the base request under the `purchaseExponent` field.


### 4. `recurringDate`

The `recurringDate` field will be added to the **BME** extension under the following conditions:

- **Condition**: The value of `recurringInd.frequencyInd` is equal to: **FIXED_FREQUENCY** (01).

If this condition is met, the `recurringDate` field will be added to the **BME** extension, as long as it is present in the base request in `bridgingMessageExtension.data.recurringData.recurringDate`.


### 5. `recurringExpiry`

The value of `recurringExpiry` is automatically calculated by the system according to the following conditions.

- **Condition 2**: The value of `threeDSAuthenticationInd` is equal to: **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (02), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (03) or the value of `threeRIInd` is equal to **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (01), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (02).
- **Condition**: If the value of `deviceChannel` in the attributes is equal to **RI** and there is no previous value for `recurringExpiry` in the base request.
- The `recurringExpiry` field is taken from the data sent in the base request.


### 6. `recurringFrequency`

The value of `recurringFrequency` will be taken from the base request under the following conditions:

- **Condition**: The value of `recurringInd.frequencyInd` is equal to **FIXED_FREQUENCY** (01).

If this condition is met, the value of `recurringFrequency` will be taken directly from the base request; otherwise, no value will be assigned to the extension.


### 7. `recurringInd`

The `recurringInd` field consists of two subfields: `amountInd` and `frequencyInd`. Both will be added to the **BME** extension under the following conditions:

- **Condition 2**: The value of `threeDSAuthenticationInd` is equal to: **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (02), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (03) or the value of `threeRIInd` is equal to **RECURRING_TRANSACTION** (01), **INSTALMENT_TRANSACTION** (02).

When this condition is met, the following subfields will be added:

#### Subfields

- **`amountInd`**: The value provided in `bridgingMessageExtension.data.recurringData.recurringInd.amountInd` will be added if present in the base request, and if not provided, `amountInd` will have a default value of **FIXED_PURCHASE** (01).

- **`frequencyInd`**: The value provided in `bridgingMessageExtension.data.recurringData.recurringInd.frequencyInd` will be added if present in the base request, and if not provided, `frequencyInd` will have a default value of **FIXED_FREQUENCY** (01).

##  Benefits of Protocol V2.3.1 with BME in 3DS and its new indicators

See more details in [Rules to consider for the session API with BME](/en/three-d-s-server/api/sessions/rules#elementos-que-podra-enviar-para-optimizar-el-uso-de-esta-extension-bme)


**threeDSRequestorAuthenticationInd:** used in the base request as: threeDSAuthenticationInd, this field includes new indicators available in version 2.3.1

- **BILLING_AGREEMENT (07):** This indicator refers to a billing agreement between the customer and the merchant, where the customer authorizes recurring or future payments without the need to authenticate each individual transaction. It is common in subscriptions or ongoing services where payments are processed periodically.

- **SPLIT_SHIPMENT (08):** Indicates that the order will be shipped in multiple shipments. This can occur when the merchant does not have all items in stock or for logistical convenience. In this case, the total charge may be split and processed based on partial shipments.

- **DELAYED_SHIPMENT (09):** Refers to a transaction in which the shipment of the order is intentionally delayed, either at the customer's request or for the merchant's logistical reasons. Payment may be processed at the time of purchase, but shipment will take place later.

- **SPLIT_PAYMENT (10):** This indicator signals that the payment for a transaction is split into several parts, either between different payment methods or at different times. For example, the customer could pay part with a credit card and the rest with another method, or pay in several installments.

- **MASTERCARD_THE_PAYMENT_REQUEST_IS_FOR_AN_AGENT_PAYMENT_TRANSACTION (85):** This indicator is used when the payment request is related to a transaction managed by an agent on behalf of the merchant or customer. It is common in cases where an agency or other intermediary manages the payment, acting as a third party facilitating the transaction between the merchant and the customer.

- **MASTERCARD_FOR_UNKNOWN_OR_UNDEFINED_FINAL_AMOUNT_BEFORE_PURCHASE_TRANSACTION (86):** This indicator is used when the final amount of the transaction is not known or not defined at the time of purchase. It is useful in situations where the total amount may vary, such as when making reservations or purchases that may involve additional charges, but the exact amount is determined later (e.g., hotel reservations, car rentals, or services with variable rates).


**threeRIInd:** This field includes new indicators available in version 2.3.1

- **DEVICE_BINDING_STATUS_CHECK (13):** This indicator is used to check the status of device binding. It refers to situations where it is necessary to verify if a device is correctly linked to an account or card, which can improve the security of recurring or payment transactions.

- **CARD_SECURITY_CODE_STATUS_CHECK (14):** This indicator allows checking the status of the card security code (CVV or CVC). It is common in transactions where additional authentication of the security code is required to validate the legitimacy of the card used.

- **DELAYED_SHIPMENT (15):** This indicator is used for transactions where the shipment of the product or service will be made at a later date. It is useful for cases where payment is processed immediately, but delivery is delayed or made later.

- **SPLIT_PAYMENT (16):** Refers to a transaction in which the payment is split into several parts. This can occur when the buyer chooses to pay in different installments or by different payment methods for a single transaction.

- **FIDO_CREDENTIAL_DELETION (17):** This indicator is used when the deletion of FIDO (Fast Identity Online) credentials associated with an account or device is requested. FIDO is an authentication standard that allows credential deletion to improve security.

- **FIDO_CREDENTIAL_REGISTRATION (18):** Used when registering new FIDO credentials. This process links a device or account to a more secure authentication method, independent of traditional passwords.

- **DECOUPLED_AUTHENTICATION_FALLBACK (19):** This indicator is activated when a failure occurs in the decoupled authentication process. Decoupled authentication allows the cardholder to authenticate on a channel other than the merchant's (e.g., via a banking app), and this code indicates that the method has failed and an alternative is required.

**transChar:** This field includes new indicators available in version 2.3.1

- **CRYPTOCURRENCY_TRANSACTION (01):** This indicator is used to identify transactions related to cryptocurrencies. It allows the issuer and other actors in the payment system to explicitly recognize when the transaction involves the purchase, sale, or exchange of cryptocurrencies, which may require special treatment due to the nature of this type of asset.

- **NFT_TRANSACTION (02):** This indicator is designed for transactions involving the purchase or exchange of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital assets based on blockchain technology, and this code helps differentiate these transactions from traditional purchases, providing an additional layer of relevant information for authentication and risk analysis.


**amountInd:** This field includes new indicators available in version 2.3.1

- **FIXED_PURCHASE (01):** Indicates that the transaction amount is fixed and does not vary. This type of purchase is common in standard transactions where the value of the product or service is predefined and does not change during the payment process.

- **VARIABLE_PURCHASE (02):** Indicates that the transaction amount may vary. It is used in cases where the final value of the purchase is not determined at the time of initial authentication, such as in situations of split shipment, additional charges, or adjustments for variable services or products. This indicator provides flexibility in handling transactions with adjustable amounts.


**frequencyInd:** This field includes new indicators available in version 2.3.1

- **FIXED_FREQUENCY (01):** Indicates that the frequency of the recurring transaction is fixed. It is used when payments are made at regular and predefined intervals, such as monthly payments, subscriptions, or loan installments. The periodicity is constant and does not change over time.

- **VARIABLE_FREQUENCY (02):** Indicates that the frequency of the recurring transaction may vary. It applies in cases where payments are not made at regular intervals, or the frequency changes according to needs or circumstances, such as in sporadic payments or when the interval between payments is not predictable. This indicator provides flexibility to handle recurring payments that do not follow a strict pattern.

## Recurring Payments

Relevant Indicators:

- **threeRIInd:** RECURRING_TRANSACTION (01)
- **amountInd:** FIXED_PURCHASE (01) or VARIABLE_PURCHASE (02)
- **frequencyInd:** FIXED_FREQUENCY (01) or VARIABLE_FREQUENCY (02)

**Use Case:** When a merchant wants to process a recurring transaction with a fixed or variable amount (such as a monthly subscription to a service or loan payment installments), the BME can be used to indicate the type of recurring transaction, the frequency of payments, and whether the amount will be fixed or variable.

**Example:** A streaming platform wants to charge a fixed monthly subscription (for example, $10), but can also handle cases where the user pays variable amounts based on usage, with a non-predefined frequency.

```json
{
  "acctNumber": "4005580000000040",

          "amountInd": "FIXED_PURCHASE"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

<Note>
    For variable amount payments, Mastercard only allows a value that is above 20% of the initial transaction. For example, if the initial payment was 1,000, in recurring transactions you can charge up to 1,200 maximum.
</Note>

## Split or Delayed Shipment

Relevant Indicators:

**threeRIInd:** DELAYED_SHIPMENT (15) or SPLIT_PAYMENT (16)

**Use Case:** For scenarios where a customer's order is split into several shipments or where the shipment is delayed, the BME can provide additional details about the nature of the payment. This is useful for managing transactions where part of the order is shipped now and another later, or when the shipment is postponed.

**Example:** A customer makes a purchase of multiple items, but some products are not available for immediate shipment. DELAYED_SHIPMENT is used to signal to the issuing bank that the transaction includes delayed shipments.

## Transactions with Digital Currencies (Cryptocurrency/NFT)

Relevant Indicators:

**transChar:** CRYPTOCURRENCY_TRANSACTION (01) or NFT_TRANSACTION (02)

**Use Case:** In situations where payment is made with cryptocurrencies or NFTs (non-fungible tokens), the BME can be used to indicate that the payment is not with traditional currency, but with digital assets. This helps issuing banks to correctly assess the risk associated with the transaction.

**Example:** A customer buys an NFT on a digital art platform using cryptocurrencies. The BME would indicate that the transaction is associated with an NFT_TRANSACTION or CRYPTOCURRENCY_TRANSACTION.

```json
{
  "acctNumber": "4005580000000040",
  "cardExpiryDate": "2411",
  "purchaseAmount": "8.25",
  "redirectURI": "https://www.placetopay.com",

        "threeDSRequestorAuthenticationInd": "SPLIT_PAYMENT"
      }
    }
  }
}


```

## Card Security Code Status Check

Relevant Indicators:

**threeRIInd:** CARD_SECURITY_CODE_STATUS_CHECK (14)

**Use Case:** This case is relevant when the merchant needs to perform a check of the card security code (CVV) associated with the card without making an immediate payment. The BME allows adding additional information indicating that the transaction is only a CVV verification.

**Example:** A card verification service performs a CVV check before a future transaction is completed. The BME would indicate this scenario without the need to process a payment.

```json
{
  "acctNumber": "4005580000000040",
  "cardExpiryDate": "2411",
  "purchaseAmount": "8.25",
  "redirectURI": "https://www.placetopay.com",
  "purchaseCurrency": "USD",
  "addPriorInformation": "Y",
  "threeDSAuthenticationInd": "ADD_CARD",
  "messageCategory": "PA",
  "deviceChannel": "RI",
  "threeRIInd": "RECURRING_TRANSACTION",
  "recurringFrequency": "031",
  "recurringExpiry": "20241020",
  "bridgingMessageExtension": {
    "data": {
      "addData": {
        "threeRIInd": "CARD_SECURITY_CODE_STATUS_CHECK",
        "cardSecurityCode": "123"
      }
    }
  }
}


```

## FIDO Credential Deletion and Registration

Relevant Indicators:

**threeRIInd:** FIDO_CREDENTIAL_DELETION (17) or FIDO_CREDENTIAL_REGISTRATION (18)

**Use Case:** These indicators are used when managing FIDO credentials, a standard for passwordless authentication. The BME can include information about the deletion or registration of FIDO credentials in the context of a transaction, improving the security of the process.

**Example:** A bank updates FIDO credentials linked to a user account. The BME would include indicators that register or delete such credentials in the transaction.

```json
{
  "acctNumber": "4005580000000040",
  "cardExpiryDate": "2411",
  "purchaseAmount": "8.25",
  "redirectURI": "https://www.placetopay.com",
  "purchaseCurrency": "USD",
  "addPriorInformation": "Y",
  "threeDSAuthenticationInd": "ADD_CARD",
  "messageCategory": "PA",
  "deviceChannel": "RI",
  "threeRIInd": "RECURRING_TRANSACTION",
  "recurringFrequency": "031",
  "recurringExpiry": "20241020",
  "bridgingMessageExtension": {
    "data": {
      "addData": {
        "threeRIInd": "FIDO_CREDENTIAL_REGISTRATION",
        "cardSecurityCode": "123"
      }
    }
  }
}
