# Authentication

To interact with the 3DS Server API, it is necessary to generate a token from the merchant; each request to the services requires this token.

This token will be sent in the HTTP header as a "Bearer Token", according to [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750).

<Note>
It is important to highlight that the token is exclusive to the merchant and should be treated securely. It should not be shared in publicly accessible areas or places where third parties can easily access it.
</Note>

**Example of a Bearer Token:**

```text
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...
```

<Note>
This token is for personal use only and will be shown only this time. Keep it in a secure place and **make sure not to lose it!
</Note>

***If the token is lost, a new one will need to be generated.***
