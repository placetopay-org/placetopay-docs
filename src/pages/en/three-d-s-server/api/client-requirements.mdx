# Integration Requirements

To integrate with Evertecâ€™s 3DS Server or 3DS Secure service, the merchant or gateway must meet the following requirements to ensure connection compatibility:

- **HTTP Headers:** HTTP headers must be set with the following values:

        Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8


- **Authentication:** All requests to the service require an authentication token. The token must be sent in the HTTP header as a "Bearer Token" according to RFC 6750. 
      
  **Bearer Token Example:**

      Authorization:"Bearer 1c6b2cda415f40f6f9f82e24d31d3fa6deb3cbcdd1def686fef7ed721a8abf83"


<Note>
This token is provided by the transactional security administrator.
</Note>

- **Secure communications:** To establish links secured by Transport Layer Security (TLS) between the service and connected clients, the version number must be 1.2 or higher. RSA keys must have a minimum length of 2048 bits.
