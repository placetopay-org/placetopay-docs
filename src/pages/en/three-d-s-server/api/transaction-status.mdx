# Authentication Process Data

Below are tables detailing authentication data for different card brands. Each table provides information on the transaction status, the value of the Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI), the presence of the Authentication Value (AV), who holds the liability, and recommended actions according to the authentication status.

## Amex, Discover, and Visa
**Successful Authentication (Y):** When authentication is successful, the ECI is 05, the Authentication Value is present, liability falls on the Issuer, and the recommendation is to proceed to authorization.

**Authentication Attempt (A):** In this state, the ECI is 06, the Authentication Value is present, liability is with the Issuer, and it is recommended to proceed to authorization.

**Authentication Not Available (U) / Not Authenticated (N) / Rejected (R):** In these cases, the ECI is 07, the Authentication Value is not present, liability is with the Merchant, and the general recommendation is to consider whether to proceed to authorization, although in cases of failed or rejected authentication, proceeding is not recommended.

## Mastercard
**Successful Authentication (Y):** When authentication is successful, the ECI is 02, the Authentication Value is present, liability falls on the Issuer, and the recommendation is to proceed to authorization.

**Authentication Attempt (A):** In this state, the ECI is 01, the Authentication Value is present, liability is with the Issuer, and it is recommended to proceed to authorization.

**Authentication Not Available (U) / Not Authenticated (N) / Rejected (R):** In these cases, the ECI is 00, the Authentication Value is not present, liability is with the Merchant, and the general recommendation is to consider whether to proceed to authorization, although in cases of failed or rejected authentication, proceeding is not recommended.

## Other States
**C - Challenge:** This state indicates that an additional authentication step is required, usually through a challenge to the cardholder.

**D - Decoupled:** This state refers to decoupled transactions.

**I - Information Only:** This state is used for transactions that only require information.

These states and values provide guidance on how to handle transactions according to the authentication results and the card brand involved. It is crucial to understand and follow these recommendations to ensure the secure and efficient processing of transactions.

> The statuses **I (Information only)** and **D (Decoupled)** are only present in versions EMV® 3DS 2.2.0 and above of the protocol.
