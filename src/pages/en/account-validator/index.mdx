## What is it?
Account Validator is a project designed to verify accounts using external services. Account verification is an additional process to ensure the authenticity and availability of accounts by validating information such as:

- The account status, that is, whether the account is active or not.
- The available balance in the account to determine if a transaction can be processed for the specified amount.

This verification process is performed before processing the transaction.
