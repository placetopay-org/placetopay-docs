## How does it work? {{id: "how-to-works"}}

Account Validator is a redirect-based project. Below are the key aspects to consider when implementing an account validation process.

1. Ensure you have a site created in the Placetopay admin panel and that the ACH account validation service is enabled.
2. Using the credentials for this site (`Login` - `TranKey`), you can start [creating sessions for account verification.](/en/account-validator/api/session)
3. Once a session is created, it will return a URL (`redirectUrl`) and a session ID (`requestId`) for status queries. By accessing the URL, the user will be presented with the account validator interface, where they can enter their account information.

    <Note>
      Please note the session expiration time, which depends on your site configuration. By default, sessions expire after 15 minutes.
    </Note>

4. After the process is completed, the user will be redirected to the URL provided during session creation (`returnUrl`).
5. With the session ID (`requestId`), you can [query the verification status](/en/account-validator/api/session).
6. Once the verification is approved, the response will indicate whether the account exists in the Vault Popular and Plaid services for ACH. However, to validate account status and amount, you must use the returned information along with the payment details to call the [account validation service](/en/account-validator/api/validate-existing-account).
