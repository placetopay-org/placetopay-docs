## Validate Existing Account {{ id: 'validate-existing-account', tag: 'POST', label: '/api/verification/validate' }}

    Once the initial session creation has been successfully completed, you can perform validations on the account as many times as needed. You only need the account information and the verification code provided in the previous process.

    **Validations performed:**

    Currently, the result of the validations is based on the following rules:

    1. **Existing account validation:** Verifies that the account exists and has gone through a session creation process from the account validator UI, and that the generated token belongs to the merchant being authenticated.
    2. **Active account validation:** Verifies that the account exists and is active with the account validation provider (PLAID, VaultPopular, Business Accounts, or MOCK as applicable).
    3. **Available amount validation:** Verifies that the account being validated has an amount greater than or equal to the amount sent in the request.
