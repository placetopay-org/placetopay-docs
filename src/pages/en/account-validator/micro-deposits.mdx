## Micro-deposits {{id: "micro-deposits"}}

To perform a micro-deposit, you must create a session as in the previous cases. Once the user is redirected to the account verification process, follow these steps: select Personal Account and choose a bank other than Banco Popular.

After selecting the bank, a pop-up window will appear to continue with the PLAID process:

To initiate micro-deposits, select Link Bank Account Manually and enter the information requested by the PLAID platform.

Once the flow is completed, a notification will be sent indicating that a micro-deposit process has started. You may attempt again with an already validated account or exit the process.

The micro-deposit process is managed by the PLAID platform, which makes small deposits to the account to validate its existence. Once completed, PLAID will notify the account validator, which will update the status:

- If rejected, the user will be notified that the micro-deposit could not be completed.
- If approved, the system will wait until 8:35 am the following day to notify the user that the micro-deposit was successful and that they must complete the process. This waiting period allows for any possible reversals, which would result in the cancellation of the micro-deposit.

Pending and validated micro-deposit processes can be viewed and continued from a new session in the account validation flow. For this, user validation will be required:

Once the OTP is entered, the user will be able to review the status of accounts validated via micro-deposits:
