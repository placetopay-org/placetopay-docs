## User Flow {{id: "user-flow"}}

Once the user is redirected to the account verification process, the following steps will occur:

Upon clicking confirm, the user will see the next screen, where they can select the account type: either a **personal account** or a **business account**:

## Personal Account {{id: "personal-account"}}

If the user selects a personal account, they must choose the bank for the account they wish to validate. If the bank is not listed, they can select the "other" option.

- **For Banco Popular**

If the account belongs to Banco Popular, the user must enter the account type and number, as well as the routing number and the last 4 digits of their social security number.

- **For other banks**

If the account does NOT belong to Banco Popular, verification will be performed through an external service (PLAID):

After selecting the bank, a pop-up window will appear to continue with the PLAID process:

<img src="/Account_validator/plaid5.png" width="280" style={{ width: '300px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />

Once the information is collected, the account validator will check if the account exists and its verification status, depending on the selected bank and account type, and will finally display the result:

<img src="/Account_validator/personal_account3.png" width="280" style={{ width: '300px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />

    <Note>
      **Retries:** If the entered account could not be verified, the validator will allow the user to retry the process up to 3 times (configurable). If all attempts are exhausted without success, the verification will be automatically rejected.
    </Note>

## Business Account {{id: "business-account"}}

If the user selects a business account, they must choose the bank for the account they wish to validate, as well as enter the account number and confirm it.

<img src="/Account_validator/business_account.png" width="280" style={{ width: '300px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />

Once the information is collected, the account validator will check if the account exists and its verification status, depending on the selected bank and account type, and will finally display the result:

<img src="/Account_validator/business_account1.png" width="280" style={{ width: '300px', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }} />

    <Note>
      **Retries:** If the entered account could not be verified, the validator will allow the user to retry the process up to 3 times (configurable). If all attempts are exhausted without success, the verification will be automatically rejected.
