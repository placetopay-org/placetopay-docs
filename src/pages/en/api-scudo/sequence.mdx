### Manual Transaction Validation

## Concepts

### Rules Engine
A system that analyzes transactions through rules and rule groups with dynamic flows defined by the client.

### Placetopay Historical Risk
This consists of performing a historical analysis of purchases made by the user through the Placetopay platform. With this information, the fraud control system generates a risk score and, depending on the configuration defined by the client, determines whether the transaction can be processed or requires validation by other security modules.

### Central Risk
Validates whether the card being used for the purchase is associated with the user's identification document. Additionally, it validates phone numbers and email addresses registered in the payment against information found in risk centers, generating a score that allows the system to decide whether the transaction is processed or continues with other security modules. This module applies only to Colombia.

### External Risk Score
Validates the reputation of the email address, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, and others associated with the transaction to identify correlations with fraudulent operations on other sites, generating a risk score that enables the system's decision-making.

### International Risk Score
Validates user information against international risk engines, enabling security validation through machine learning systems, generating a risk score based on the analysis of multiple variables associated with users' payment behavior worldwide.

### Access to the Administrative Console
Through our Placetopay platform, it is possible to configure the fraud control system, view transactions, applied rules, users, create invitations, and generate reports and statistics.
