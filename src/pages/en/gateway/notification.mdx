# Notification

When a transaction is processed, an HTTP notification (Webhook) is sent to the merchant. {{ className: 'lead' }}

To receive notifications, you must send the `notificationURL` field with a notification URL. Each time a transaction is processed, an HTTP request will be made to that endpoint with useful information about the transaction status.

```json {{ 'title': 'Notification' }}
{
  "status": {
    "status": "APPROVED",
    "reason": "00",
    "message": "Aprobada",
    "date": "2024-07-11T15:22:37-05:00"
  },
  "internalReference": 1,
  "reference": "5834381",
  "signature": "9c0f8ff164d0af4a795f71ee127d8926f56d05fb"
}
```

## Notification Reception {{ id: 'notification-reception'}}

To make use of this notification, in your application you must:

**Identify the transaction:** With `internalReference` and `reference`, you must search for the payment in your system. This should match a transaction you previously created.

**Validate message signature:** You can validate that the notification is an authentic message from Placetopay by generating and comparing the signature.

The signature is generated with the following formula: `SHA-1(internalReference + status.status + secretKey)`

If the generated `signature` is equal to the `signature` received in the message, then the notification is authentic.

**Update Information:** If all you need is the final status of the transaction, then you can update the status in your system.

If you need additional information, you must query the transaction using the `internalReference`.
