# Types of transactions

## Authorization
An authorization refers to the process that is executed after the user enters the requested information and it is sent to the network to make the payment.

---

## Recurring payment
It is a periodic charge made by PlacetoPay for the same value with an interval (daily, monthly, annual) according to the indication given in the request.

To make use of this functionality, in the payment structure of the Recurring Payment it is necessary to send the mandatory data for this structure in the recurring object.

# Pre-authorization

Pre-authorization is a transaction used to reserve (**checkin**) an amount of money on a credit card. This amount can later be debited (**checkout**). During the process, the amount may change (**reauthorization**) according to the merchantâ€™s needs or modifications in the services chosen by the cardholder. 

> Note: If a **CHECKIN**, **REAUTHORIZATION**, or **CHECKOUT** transaction fails due to an abnormal status, it will be canceled and marked as rejected, but it can be retried. The failed transaction will have a **VR** status.

---

## Check-In

The **CHECKIN** transaction is used to obtain authorization from the bank (provider). It is defined as a debit to a credit or debit card that serves as a guarantee deposit for the use of a good or service.

### Checkin Request

To ensure quick integration, **CHECKIN** requests are similar to those of the `processTransaction` method, with the following differences:

- The **"action"** must be `checkin`.
- The payment reference will be reused in subsequent **REAUTHORIZATION** and **CHECKOUT** operations.
- The payment currency will also remain the same in **REAUTHORIZATION** and **CHECKOUT**.
- **Dispersion details** (multiple transactions to different collectors with the same cardholder information) are not considered.
- **Recurrence details** (recurring charges from a proprietary database) are not included.
 
> **IMPORTANT:** The `preAuthorization` node contains the data that will be used in subsequent **REAUTHORIZATION** and **CHECKOUT** operations. Additionally, it reflects the general status of the pre-authorization process.

## Re-Authorization

> Not applicable to Puerto Rico

The **REAUTHORIZATION** transaction modifies the previously defined security deposit amount in a **CHECKIN** transaction, requesting a new authorization from the bank (provider).

### Reauthorization Request

A **CHECKIN** request must be made before processing a **REAUTHORIZATION**. Considerations:

- The payment reference is overwritten by the original **CHECKIN** session.
- The payment currency is overwritten by the original **CHECKIN** session.
- The values for `internalReference` and `authorization` must match those provided in the **CHECKIN** response within the `preAuthorization` node.
- Multiple **REAUTHORIZATION** transactions can be performed before **CHECKOUT**.
- Each reauthorization must be for an amount greater than `0`.
 
After this operation, the pre-authorization remains in a **pending** state until a **CHECKOUT** is performed.

---

## Check-out

The **CHECKOUT** transaction confirms the security deposit amount previously separated with a **CHECKIN** or **REAUTHORIZATION** transaction. This formalizes the transaction (purchase/settlement) with the provider.

### Checkout Request
 
Key considerations:
 
- A **CHECKOUT** can be performed without a prior **REAUTHORIZATION**.
- The payment reference is overwritten by the original **CHECKIN** session.
- The payment currency is overwritten by the original **CHECKIN** session.
- The values for `internalReference` and `authorization` must match those provided in the **CHECKIN** response within the `preAuthorization` node.
- If the **CHECKOUT** amount is `0`, the pre-authorization is canceled, and the retained amount is released.
 
> **IMPORTANT:** The values of `status`, `authorization`, and `receipt` within the `preAuthorization` node change after a successful **CHECKOUT**. These updated values must be used in **REVERSE** requests.

---

## Dispersion

This type of transaction is used to split the payment between different entities besides the main site. That is, when making a transaction, part of the value is directed to the site authenticated in the transaction, and another part is sent to an airline or other sites. Additionally, this allows each part of the transaction to be processed by different providers.

The dispersal transaction is made up of a parent session of type `DISPERSION` that contains the total value of the transaction and the general state of the process, and also by daughter sessions of type `AUTH_ONLY` that contain the information of each of the parties. scattered. The authorization and receipt data of the parent transaction will be the same as the first transaction processed.

In the event that a transaction remains pending, the other pending transactions will not be processed until it is resolved, leaving a status of `PENDING_PROCESS`. The parent transaction will maintain its `PENDING` state until all child sessions are resolved.

In the event that a transaction fails or is rejected, other pending transactions will automatically be rejected as well, without establishing contact with the network. If a child transaction has already been approved previously, it maintains its state and the parent transaction will change its state to `APPROVED_PARTIAL`.

Transactions can be reversed together or separately. If a rollback is sent to a child transaction, only the child transaction will be rolled back. If a rollback is sent to the parent transaction, all transactions will be rolled back.

### Airline dispersion

When a dispersal is made to an airline, it will be prioritized and processed first. If 3DS or credit is configured, this configuration will be used only in processing the airline transaction.

Airline dispersions are limited to just two parties: one from the main business and one from the airline. It is also possible to perform a spread in which the total value of the transaction is redirected to the airline, by not sending the trade spread or sending it with a zero value.

### Business dispersion

Merchant spreads allow a split transaction to be made across up to 3 sites, including the authenticated site. Child transactions will be processed in the order sent in the transaction.
