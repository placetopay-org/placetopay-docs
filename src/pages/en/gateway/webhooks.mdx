# Webhooks

A webhook is a notification sent to a URL using an HTTPS request. At Placetopay, webhooks allow external systems to receive real-time information about the status of a transaction. {{ className: 'lead' }} 

Webhooks is a new feature that is intended to complement the cases covered by the [Transaction Notification](/gateway/notification) feature. Currently only the use case for _Webhook ACH returns_ is covered.

## Webhook for ACH returns

The webhook for ACH returns allows merchants to receive real-time notifications about returns on their site.

- **Purpose**: Notify the merchant when an ACH return occurs.
- **Configuration**: Configured in the Placetopay administrative panel through the operations team, providing the desired URL.
- **Event**: HTTPS notification sent when an ACH return is generated.
- **Information sent**: All direct session-related information.

### Signature validation

To ensure the authenticity of the notification, each webhook from Placetopay includes a signature in the `X-Signature` header. You can validate this signature using an HMAC SHA-256 hash generated with the content of the notification body (`body`) and the transaction key (`tranKey`) of your site.

```javascript {{ title: 'Validation in JavaScript' }}
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Body of the request and received signature
const body = JSON.stringify(notificationBody);
const receivedSignature = headers['X-Signature'];

const tranKey = 'YOUR_SITE_TRANKEY';

// Generate the signature locally
const generatedSignature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', tranKey)
  .update(body)
  .digest('hex');

// Validate the signature
if (generatedSignature === receivedSignature) {
  console.log("The notification is authentic.");
} else {
  console.log("Invalid signature: the notification is not authentic.");
}
```
