# Processing with bank accounts

To process transactions using a bank account as a payment instrument, it is necessary to implement the account payment instrument that allows defining the account data to be used, as well as the mechanisms to validate the account using account validation services such as: Account Validator.

## Resources

#### [Processing API](/en/gateway/api/reference/transaction)
#### [Account validator API](/en/account-validator)

## Bank account instrument

```json
 "account": {
    "bankName": "Test Bank",
    "bankCode": "0001234",
    "accountType": "SAV",
    "accountNumber": "4111111111111111"
  }
```

### Type of bank accounts

Type | Description
-----|----------
 SAV | Personal savings account
 DDA | Personal checking account
 CCD | Business account

## Account validation

To ensure security in bank account processing, it is recommended to use the Account Validator bank account validation service.

With this service, before initiating the payment, the account owner is required to perform a verification operation in a graphical interface.

Once the account owner completes this process, the service is consulted via API and the Account object is obtained with a verification code delivered by the service.

The processing API will be in charge of validating this code delivered by Account Validator and determining if the account has passed the validations, if not, the processing will not continue.

### Example of account with validation code

```json
{
  "bankCode": "0001234",
  "bankName": "Banco NO Popular",
  "accountType": "SAV",
  "accountNumber": "4111111111111111",
  "franchise": "_0001234_",
  "verificationCode": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJhY2NvdW50SGFzaCI6IjhlM2Q0NDg0ZjIwOTc2ODBmNDA4YzEyMmQ0ZjJiZTdiMDM3YTUzMzIzNmEwNTdmZjdjMzJhMDYwNjFkY2M5MTU0YmRmNGEyOTViNmE4MDUwMmE5N2RiYWFmZGU0YTE2ZmU1MDM0MTQzMTQ2MmFjY2I0N2I5MmIyN2I3MDM2YjQ4Iiwib25UZXN0IjpmYWxzZSwic2VydmljZSI6InBsYWlkIiwiZXhwIjoxNzEzNTYxMDE1fQ.FcEj-HRdf1V6Ypl8db5p7auI_6MTdMrGK34H2u3LeA0KBLzJHc86rFufRsdCqlRoCLc2TuKmxzWVin6QEMtqtxasoeMUqhXo81rhBtHEA0Flj_XNiAFhcP8IEn2dJV8-60oscvSfbVRBKN_5Lk3HqLWNqe0ECDJROWm9lXdYf2tZCukuMWPvVPc91Fg9kO2qHH1wrcc7G_JRdy09LQlAs_MS5_sLdEkFLsS5o5RxwNsknWUkUZuljMlz8Z8vd8GxKg7V5iaBh8r3djsQXJ_EFzk9XLv8P0Ca2MoQ9X1yEVa8HHEdRjlB9OKm7u7_1HyjqAKb_XwWYaRESHrAXC0opQ"
}
```

## Tokenization

A bank account can be tokenized in such a way that charges can be made to said account without the account owner being present.

In this flow, once the account has been validated, a token that represents the account can be generated and can be used to make new transactions.

Check the section [Tokenization](/en/gateway/api/reference/tokenization) of the API.

## Test Environment

Placetopay has a test environment in which integration flows can be carried out before moving to the production environment.

To simulate different transaction flows (approved, rejected, failed), a transaction simulator is provided with the following accounts enabled:
