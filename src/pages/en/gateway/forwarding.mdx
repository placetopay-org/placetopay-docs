# Forwarding

It is a configuration that can be made to the site or merchant, necessary when a site has more than one payment method of the same brand (Visa and Mastercard), but with different providers and it is necessary to set the main acquirer.

This feature allows the site to determine which provider and acquirer should be used in each transaction with a current credit card, ensuring a consistent flow between the different processors available.

<Note>This applies only to transactions with Visa, Mastercard card and current credit type.</Note>

### How to verify if a payment method has the forwarding configured?

When a request is made to the `information` endpoint, the property `hasForwarding` is always present in the response. However, its value will be `true` only when the forwarding feature is configured correctly. This indicates that the system can direct the transactions to the appropriate provider based on the rules defined for the payment method.

### Forwarding behavior with credits in the forwarding flow

When a response is received where the property `hasForwarding` is `true`, it is essential that the credits included in that same response are stored in a temporary memory. These credits come along with the first `information` request and should not be modified in the subsequent requests.

In all transactions and subsequent requests after the first `information` request, you must use and display the user the same credits obtained initially. This ensures consistency and accuracy in the flow, especially in the processing request or other interactions related to it.

Therefore, the forwarding operates correctly, ensuring that the rules configured are respected and preventing inconsistencies in the data sent.

### Example of forwarding request

When the property **hasForwarding** is set to `true` in the `information` request, it is necessary to include the attribute **credit** in the object **instrument** of the following requests:
- **Information request**
- **Transaction processing**
- **3DS Lookup**
- **3DS Query**
- **OTP Generation**
- **OTP Validation**
```json
    // ...
    "instrument": {
        "card": {
            "number": "4111111111111111",
            "expiration": "12/31",
            "cvv": "303"
        },
        "credit": {
            "code": "1",
            "type": "00",
            "groupCode": "C",
            "installments": 1
        }
    }
    // ...
```
