# Response Codes

Here you will find the list of codes that the API returns in the `status` object. It is important to differentiate between authentication errors (which prevent access to the system) and processing errors.

## Authentication Errors

These codes indicate problems with credentials (`login`, `tranKey`, etc).

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **100** | Authentication not provided or malformed header. |
| **101** | The provided `login` does not exist or is incorrect. |
| **102** | The `tranKey` is incorrect or the hash does not match. |
| **103** | The `seed` has expired (difference greater than 5 minutes). |
| **104** | The site (Merchant) is inactive. |

## Transaction States
