# Charges in AutoPay
A charge in **AutoPay** refers to the amount that is attempted to be collected on each scheduled date of the autopay. There are several ways in which the amount to be charged can be defined, known as **“Charge Types.”**

## Charge types
The charge type defines the charging modality, that is, how the amount to be charged is determined in each autopay execution (for example, total balance, minimum payment, etc.). Below are the charge types available in the AutoPay system and how they operate within the general flow.

| Charge type            | What it charges                                                           | Source of the amount at execution                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TOTAL_BALANCE`        | The **total balance** required for the period (total to pay according to recurrence). | The [**balance**](/autopay/contracts/balance) of the obligation is queried via the merchant API if it is enabled for each payment to be executed.                                                                                             |
| `MINIMUM_BALANCE`      | The **minimum payment** required for the period.                          | The [**balance**](/autopay/contracts/balance) is queried to obtain the minimum amount for the period for each payment to be executed.                                                                                                        |
| `FIXED`                | A **fixed amount** specified by the merchant/user.                        | The amount is provided in the request or, if not, it will be selected by the user at the time of autopay confirmation.                                                                                                                     |
