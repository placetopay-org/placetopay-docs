# AutoPay (BETA)

**AutoPay Placetopay** is an automatic payment service that allows merchants to enable recurring or scheduled charges using a payment method previously authorized by the user (card or compatible bank account), without requiring manual intervention for each transaction. The solution includes a guided enrollment experience for the end user, API services for the merchant to create and manage autopay sessions, and execution processes that trigger charges according to the defined configuration.

## Why is it useful?

- **Improved conversion and retention:** reduces friction in repetitive payments (services, insurance, telcos, subscriptions).
- **Operational automation:** eliminates manual processes and reminders; charges are executed on the agreed dates.
- **Control and transparency:** the merchant can review, adjust, or cancel their autopays.
- **Security and compliance:** use of tokenized payment methods and PCI guidelines, with authentication options (e.g., 3DS 3RI when applicable).
- **Integrability:** in addition to direct checkout integration, the ecosystem exposes endpoints for creation/update/deactivation and querying of sessions/autopays; webhooks are also supported to notify relevant events.

## How does it work?

1) [**AutoPay API:**](/en/autopay/api)
As a client, you can interact with the AutoPay API to perform actions on your users’ autopays, such as creation, querying, updating, and deactivation.

2) [**Direct client integration:**](/en/autopay/contracts)
As a client, your application can expose certain endpoints so AutoPay can interact with them, obtain the necessary invoice information to process a payment ([Balance](/autopay/contracts/balance)), record the results of each payment ([Settlement](/autopay/contracts/settlement)), and receive updated information about the autopay status ([Webhooks](/autopay/contracts/webhook)).

In this documentation you will find all the information required to integrate AutoPay into your platform.
