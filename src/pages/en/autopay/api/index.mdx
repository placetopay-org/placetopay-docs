# AutoPay API Reference

Welcome to the AutoPay technical reference. Our API is built on RESTful principles, uses **JSON** for data exchange, and standard HTTP response codes.

## Environments and Base URL

All requests must be sent to the following base URLs, depending on the environment you are in:

| Environment | Base URL | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sandbox** | `https://api-test.placetopay.com` | Used for development and testing. Does not process real money. |
| **Production** | `https://api.placetopay.com` | Real transactional environment. |

## Headers

All API requests must include the following HTTP headers to ensure the content is interpreted correctly:

```json
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    User-Agent: YourApp/1.0 (Recommended to identify your traffic)
```

## Standard response structure

Regardless of the endpoint, all API responses follow a common structure. You will always receive a `status` object indicating the technical result of the operation.

```json
    {
        "status": {
            "status": "OK",
            "reason": "00",
            "message": "The request has been processed successfully",
            "date": "2023-06-21T09:56:06-05:00"
        },
        ...,
    }
```

* **`status`**: Indicates the success (`OK`) or failure (`FAILED`) of the technical request.
* **`reason`**: Internal code for programmatic error handling.
* **`message`**: Readable description of the result.
* **`*`** : Contains the requested information (e.g., session details, transaction list).
