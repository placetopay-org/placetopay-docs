## Client API contracts when integrating AutoPay

<Note type="warning">
    **baseURL**: This is the base URL of the client/merchant application, which must be provided by the merchant and configured during the AutoPay onboarding process.
</Note>

To operate AutoPay end to end, the client/merchant must expose a set of their own endpoints that follow the contracts defined in this documentation.

These endpoints allow Placetopay to:
- Query the balance/amount to be charged.
- Confirm the application of a payment.
- Receive notifications about the AutoPay lifecycle (activation, update, deactivation, execution results).

In this section, you can find more information about the contracts and examples of each of the services you must implement.

<Note type="warning">
    As a client, when implementing these contracts you must implement authentication based on *Basic Authentication*. This allows you to identify us and validate the information so your operations remain secure. See more at [**Contract authentication**](/autopay/contract-authentication).
</Note>
