# API de administración y gestión de tokens

---
## Información General

This API provides a set of methods that enable PAN tokenization. Given a PAN, you can return
a token and use it for e-commerce and mobile payments. These APIs are known as token management
and also provide a set of notifications you can subscribe to for any token status changes.

Typically, a Token Requestor client enrolls a merchant, enrolls a PAN, and provides a token
given a PAN piece of data. The client can then obtain payment data and manage tokens
(e.g., suspend, resume, or delete them).

Token Requestor clients must handle event notifications related to token status
(created, updated, key changed), PAN metadata, and payment transactions. Specifically,
the client must call the Token Status API when it receives a token status notification.
