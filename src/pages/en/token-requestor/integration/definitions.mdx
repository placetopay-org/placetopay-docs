# Key Definitions

## Consumer - _**Customer**_

The main entity representing a payment gateway or an external client that owns
one or more merchants registered in the system. This consumer may be a company
or individual responsible for managing access credentials and the merchants subscribed to the Token Requestor.

## Merchant Brand - _**Merchant Brand**_

This is the representation of a merchant before the brand **VISA** or **MASTERCARD**.
A merchant can have multiple entries in Merchant Brand, one for each brand they accept.
This entity originates from the onboarding process with the brand, during which the merchantis registered for token generation purposes.
If the merchant is registered under multiple consumers, there will still be only one Merchant Brand record for each brand.

## Merchant - _**Merchant**_

Represents a specific merchant linked to a consumer. It is the unit that will be billed
for the generation and management of tokens. In order to manage tokens, a merchant must
be associated with an active Merchant Brand.

## Credentials

These represent the authentication and authorization data linked to a consumer.
These credentials enable secure access to the API and are designed to manage
brand tokensexclusively for the merchants associated with that consumer.
Furthermore, the consumer has the ability to generate multiple custom credentials,
applying personalized filters **include or exclude** to define more precisely which
merchants can manage brand tokens using those credentials. This allows for more
granular control over the operation and security of their merchants.
