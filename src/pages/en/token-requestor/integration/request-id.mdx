# Use of the Request Identifier - _**requestId**_

If the user loses connection or is unable to retrieve the generated token,
they can call the token generation service again. This service uses the request
identifier to recover the existing token without the need to generate a new one from the brand.

However, if the endpoint is called again with the same identifier
**after 5 minutes** of generating the token, it will return an error
indicating that the identifier already exists.
