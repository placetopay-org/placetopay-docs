      summary: Lock or unlock payment order
      description: |
        This endpoint allows **locking** or **unlocking** a payment order.  
        - When a payment order is **locked**, its payment status appears as `"in process"` in the admin panel and cannot be edited or deleted.  
        - To unlock it, use the `revoke: true` field.  
        - The operation requires the **unique ID of the payment order** generated by the system.
