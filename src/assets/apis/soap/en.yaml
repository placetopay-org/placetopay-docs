  description: "This web service and its architecture allows any application to connect to Placetopay to process transactions, independent of the development language.

      To use the web service, you will need to have a programming language that can communicate with a SOAP service.

      ### Services

      All consumption is made to the base URL, which will be provided by the operations area and the endpoint of the service to be consumed is added to said URL.

      For example, if the base URL was https://placetopay.com, to consume the service and request information, a POST is made with the data from the example to the URL https://placetopay.com/soap"
