    description: "This web service and its architecture allows any application to connect to Placetopay to process transactions, independent of the development language.

      To use the web service, you will need to have a programming language that can communicate with a REST service.

      The integration method contemplates the basic operations for the processing of non-face-to-face cards, that is, types of credit, interest, OTP generation, authorization, reverse.

      Each of the uses and the data required in the plot for each of the cases will be described below. The response for each operation is unified into a single resulting frame type.

      By default the language of the responses is in Spanish, if you wish to change it is necessary to send the `locale` parameter in the requests.

      ### Services

      All consumption is made to the base URL, which will be provided by the operations area and the endpoint of the service to be consumed is added to said URL.

      For example, if the base URL was https://placetopay.com, to consume the service and request information, a POST is made with the data from the example to the URL https://placetopay.com/gateway/information"
